post-title: Direct Help to Eastern Europe
post-summary: "$2,250 was given to Direct Help to Eastern Europe to provide all 150 children at the Verbskaya Home & Boarding School for Orphans in Verba, Ukraine with insulated winter boots to help keep their feet warm and prevent them from being exposed to the cold. Direct Help to Eastern Europe is one organization working to alleviate some of the conditions in which these Ukrainian orphans live. These children will have come from other orphanages or directly from the streets. Olena Ivanova Baran, for instance, is finishing the 11th grade there. She and her siblings went into the orphanage five years ago when their parents died. Winters in Ukraine are very cold, of course, and one of the greatest current needs is to be able to provide the children with winter clothing. Ukraine is one of 18 countries that experienced a decline in its Human Development Index between 1990 and 2003, in large part as a result of the economic changes that resulted after the break-up of the former Soviet Union. According to UNICEF, children often bear the brunt of the poverty: "some mothers cannot cope and either abandon their children or give them up to orphanages. More than 100,000 children in Ukraine currently live in such institutions." In fact, many of these mothers themselves were abandoned as children."
