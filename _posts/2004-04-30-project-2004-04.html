post-summary: "$1,570 was given to Onneyshan to fund the construction of 24 water-seal latrines in Lalmath Basti, a slum in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, where 25 million people live in abject poverty earning less than a dollar a day, only an estimated 14% of slum households in the metropolitan cities have sanitary latrines. Unbelievably, 125,000 Bangladeshi children die every year because of diarrheal diseases. Open defacation pollutes the water that poor families there use for cooking, cleaning, and bathing. 50%-60% of the funds we donated for this project are recoverable: beneficiaries of the project make payments in very small portions over time and the money that is returned will ultimately be reinvested into an expansion of the sanitation project."
