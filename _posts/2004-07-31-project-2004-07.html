post-summary: "$1,830 was given to Vision International Eye Missions to purchase surgical instrument trays and subsidize cataract eye surgeries at an eye hospital in Madagascar. As many as 150,000 people suffer from blindness in Madagascar; half of these people could have their vision restored with appropriate surgery. The trays bought with the grant from The $10 Club will double the hospital's capacity to perform eye surgeries, benefitting literally thousands of people annually, as the surgeons there can perform ten to fifteen operations a day with each tray."
