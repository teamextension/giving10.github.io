post-title: Women's Global Education Project
post-summary: $3,720 was given to the Women's Global Education Project to facilitate the education of 60 girls in rural Senegalese villages. Our grant supported the education of 35 girls in elementary school and 25 girls in secondary school. We provided 100% of their school fees for the entire coming school year; bought all of their school supplies including knapsacks, books, notebooks, pens, and pencils; and additionally we provided personal items such as soap for the girls for the year. Only half of Senegalese children finish a full course of primary school. Half of Senegalese children and seventy percent of adult women are illiterate (compare this to the fact that fifty percent of adult men are illiterate).

<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your October 2007 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>The West-African nation of Senegal ranks 156th out of the 177 nations on the UN Human Development Index. Life expectancy at birth is 56 and a quarter of children under five are underweight for their age. 2.7 million of the 12 million citizens of the country lack access to a sustainable water source. According to the UN, women in rural Senegal spend 15-17 hours per week collecting water, which sometimes requires walking as much as 10 kilometers.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most startling figures relate to education. According to UNESCO, only half of Senegalese children finish a full course of primary school. Half of Senegalese children and seventy percent of adult women are illiterate (compare this to the fact that fifty percent of adult men are illiterate). A number of factors contribute to the difficulty in children getting an education in Senegal: overcrowding in schools; lack of resources, electricity, and running water; and teacher's strikes.</p>

<p>The Women's Global Education Project was established to provide girls in Kenya and Senegal with access to education in an effort to empower them to build better lives and foster equitable communities. Through their Sisters to School program, the organization works to help girls enroll in school, ensure they continue their schooling beyond elementary levels, promote community awareness of the importance of girls' education, and build capacity among local organizations.</p>

<h3>Giving $10</h3>
<p>This month, 372 of us joined together to donate $3,720 to the Women's Global Education Project to facilitate the education of 60 girls in rural Senegalese villages. Our grant will support the education of 35 girls in elementary school and 25 girls in secondary school. We will provide 100% of their school fees for the entire coming school year; we will buy all of their school supplies including knapsacks, books, notebooks, pens, and pencils; and additionally we will provide personal items such as soap for the girls for the year. Thank you.</p>

<p>Sisters to School already has a great record of success. This past year, all 56 of their girl scholars passed their year-end exams and will be moving on to the next school level. More than half of them ranked in the top 10 of their respective classes and two of them ranked first in their class!</p>

<p>So this month our simple ten dollar sacrifice will empower scores of Senegalese girls to get the education they need in order to build a better, more sustainable life for themselves and their families. This is a gift that will literally change their lives forever.</p>
