post-title:  Visakha Society for the Protection and Care of Animals
post-summary: $2,460 was given to the Visakha Society for the Protection and Care of Animals in India to provide 5,000 food packets to homeless people in need - serving dozens of people for an entire year. Called the Kindness Mobile Restaurant, roughly eighty people are served weekly in three different areas. A wholesome and nutritious vegan meal (lentils, vegetable curry, fruit and one sachet of drinking water) is hygienically packed in palm leaves and provided by auto-rickshaw to the poorest of the poor three days a week (when other charities in the area are not operating).
