post-title: Imani House
post-summary: "$3,260 was given to Imani House for their clinic and educational operations in Liberia to provide: medicines for the clinic; materials for the sewing class and a sewing machine; a one year's stipend for the clinic nurse; stationary and clinic charts; and gas, tires and transportation costs for their vehicle. The more than three million inhabitants of the West African nation of Liberia, still emerging from 14 years of civil war, face numerous serious challenges. Life expectancy is just about 40 years old; half the adult population is illiterate; and 39% of the population is undernourished. Our grant will enable Ms. Iderabdullah to acquire chloroquine injections to fight malaria, baby liquids and tablets, paracetamol, antihistamines, needles, syringes, antispasmodics, hypertension medication, thermometers, gauze, bandages, antiseptics, pain killers, dental supplies, birthing kits, and water proof bedding supplies. Additionally, twenty women are already registered in the sewing class. During the civil war, the offices were looted and all the sewing machines were lost. Three of them have been replaced and one more is needed. The women use their newly-learned sewing skills to design and produce clothing to wear and to sell. For some, it will be the only source of income for their families."

<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your June 2006 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>The more than three million inhabitants of the West African nation of Liberia, still emerging from 14 years of civil war, face numerous serious challenges. Life expectancy is just about 40 years old; half the adult population is illiterate; and 39% of the population is undernourished.</p>

<p>Imani House was started in Liberia in 1986 to respond to the literacy and health needs of Liberian children and adults. The clinic serves 200-400 women and children each week, offering maternal and child health care, immunizations, pre-natal care and emergency deliveries, dental care, and health education. Staff and volunteers also provide education and vocational training to help generate much-needed income.</p>

<h3>Giving $10</h3>

<p>This month, 326 of us donated $3,260 to Imani House to provide: medicines for the clinic; materials for the sewing class and a sewing machine; a one year's stipend for the clinic nurse; stationary and clinic charts; and gas and transportation costs. When I told Imani House Executive Director Bisi Iderabdullah that I'd have $200 more for her than anticipated, she asked to put it toward a new set of tires for the clinic vehicle, as the car is very unsafe since the existing tires are bald. Thank you.</p>

<p>In a country where water and electricity are constantly turned off due to lack of resources, administering to those in need is quite a challenge. Availability of medicines and health education are essential. Watta Konneh, a 23 year old gardener says </p> <blockquote>the clinic helped me have my first child the nutrition education has helped me in this pregnancy because my blood was very low and I was always weak, but now I feel strong.</blockquote>

<p>Our grant will enable Ms. Iderabdullah to acquire chloroquine injections to fight malaria, baby liquids and tablets, paracetamol, antihistamines, needles, syringes, antispasmodics, hypertension medication, thermometers, gauze, bandages, antiseptics, pain killers, dental supplies, birthing kits, and water proof bedding supplies. Parents line up at the clinic at six in the morning to be seen by clinic screening staff and get the wholesome breakfast that is prepared for them each morning. Thanks to you, the clinic shelves will be well-stocked!</p>

<p>Additionally, twenty women are already registered in the sewing class. During the civil war, the offices were looted and all the sewing machines were lost. Three of them have been replaced and one more is needed. The women use their newly-learned sewing skills to design and produce clothing to wear and to sell. For some, it will be the only source of income for their families.</p>

<p>Imani is the Swahili word for "faith". The desperate individuals who survive thanks to the work of Imani House surely have faith in the clinic workers and educators there to eradicate hunger, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat malaria and other diseases, and teach skills that will elevate their quality of life for years to come.</p>

<p>24 year old Rita Mason has faith in the clinic. She has taken her sick children there, delivered one of her children there, and has received prenatal care there. The clinic has made my children healthier because of the medicines and health talks, she writes. As a result, Rita's family spends "less money on treatment and more for food."</p>

<p>And I have faith in you.</p>
