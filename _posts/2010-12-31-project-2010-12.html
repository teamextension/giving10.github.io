post-title: ACODO Orphanage
post-summary: $2,700 was given to ACODO orphanage in Cambodia to provide the flood-affected children there with rice, vegetables, salt, garlic, seasonings, cooking oil, soy sauce, fresh fruit and drinking water as part of their daily meals. As a result of our contribution, all 65 children will have access to these staples of their regular diet for more than a month. The age of the children at the facility varies from 3 to 19. Many are former homeless street children who were vulnerable to exploitation from others. ACODO saved them from becoming beggars, prostitutes or criminals. They no longer have to scavenge in the local garbage bin for their next meal. The orphanage flooded after heavy rains in October 2010 (which resulted in tens of millions of dollars worth of damage to the nation's infrastructure) and the directors of the organization found themselves in desperate need of financial assistance to underwrite the daily food requirements for the children.

<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your December 2010 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<img src="/images/projects/project2010dec3.jpg" style="float: right !important;" />

<p>Young girls trek through knee-deep, trash-filled water carrying even younger children on their backs; the bottom row of wooden storage lockers are left opened, their contents flooded out; bicycles, used to transport those lucky enough to have them, are rendered inoperable as waters rise nearly over the tires.</p>

<p>ACODO (Assisting Cambodian Orphans and the Disabled Organization) was established in 2008 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to combat the problems of illiteracy and poverty among orphans and vulnerable children, children with HIV/AIDS, children abusing drugs, children suffering sexual harassment and exploitation, and others in need.</p>

<p>The ACODO orphanage in Cambodia flooded after heavy rains in October 2010 (which resulted in tens of millions of dollars worth of damage to the nation's infrastructure) and the directors of the organization found themselves in desperate need of financial assistance to underwrite the daily food requirements for the children.</p>

<h3>Giving $10</h3>

<p>This month, 270 of us joined together to donate $2,700 to ACODO to provide the children there with rice, vegetables, salt, garlic, seasonings, cooking oil, soy sauce, fresh fruit and drinking water as part of their daily meals. As a result of your contribution, all 65 children will have access to these staples of their regular diet for more than a month. Thank you.</p>

<p>Our donation is particularly significant as ACODO does not have access to financial or practical help from the government, corporations or international aid organizations. All infrastructural and operational costs are financed by donations from kind individuals around the world like you.</p>

<p>The age of the children at the facility varies from 3 to 19. Many are former homeless street children who were vulnerable to exploitation from others. ACODO saved them from becoming beggars, prostitutes or criminals. They no longer have to scavenge in the local garbage bin for their next meal. Many of the children have progressed from street kids with no long term goals to children with challenging career desires. Their ambitions vary from being a tour guide, an engineer, a language teacher, an art teacher and a doctor.</p>

<p>The last thing at-risk Cambodian children need is to lose their ability to receive daily meals because of flooding. Thanks to you, they will be able to get through the volatile post-flooding period without a problem. And perhaps see a bright future again in 2011 and beyond.</p>

<p>PS. Please get in your 2011 donations right away so we can get to work saving lives across the globe in the New Year!</p>
