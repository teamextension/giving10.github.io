post-title: Jinpa Project
post-summary: "$680 was given to pay for the purchase of mattresses, blankets, rice-filled pillows, and bedcovers at a new community shelter for the elderly at Parka in the Qinghai Province through the Jinpa Project, a small group helping people in Tibet. This gift is intended to improve the lives of these revered elderly members of the community. The Jinpa Project was founded by a group of monks living in Nepal who wanted to help the poverty-stricken people living in West Nangchen, a county in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The shelter for the elderly is sorely needed according to Dr. E.A. Carswell of The Jinpa Project: \"There are around 20 very elderly people at Lachen monastery at present. Nineteen of the 20 are old ladies. This elderly group spends all day, every day praying and reciting mantras for better reincarnations and for better lives for all living beings. Those that are fit enough, circumambulate around the mani stones and stupas endlessly. Those too infirm to do this, sit in a corner of the freezing main room of the monastery, spinning their prayer wheels and chanting mantras. They all suffer from arthritis and are in constant pain. There is no proper accommodation for these old people. At present they make do with odd corners in the monastery for shelter and meager handouts of food from the monks to see out their lives. Recently a visiting Westerner heard rustling coming from a corner of a derelict room and thought it was rats. Sadly it was an old lady who had been sleeping in the corner under some remains of cardboard boxes.\""
