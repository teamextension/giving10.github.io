post-title: Maun Homeopathy Project
post-summary: $3,700 was given to the Maun Homeopathy Project to administer homeopathic remedies to people living with HIV/AIDS in Botswana. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS estimates that between 260,000 and 350,000 people in Botswana live with HIV, including an estimated 14,000 children under 14. Approximately 120,000 children there have been orphaned by AIDS. The Maun Homeopathy Project uses homeopathic treatments to relieve the ill-effects of trauma, shock, and grief among those impacted by AIDS deaths; improve physical and emotional health of HIV positive patients; and reduce distressing symptoms and side-effects of other AIDS treatments. Homeopathic remedies are made from natural sources, mostly plants, minerals, and metals, which undergo a process of potentization. Homeopathy is safe medicine without risks of addiction, toxicity, or side-effects. It is a holistic system of healing which has been used globally for centuries.

<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your March 2008 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:italic;">Pelontle is a young woman of 25 living in Botswana who was diagnosed with HIV in 2004 and is on anti-retroviral drugs. Her mother died when she was very young; she was then abandoned by father and brought up by her grandmother. She has two children, the first one born when she was 15. Their father left. Pelontle has worked sporadically collecting rubbish but mostly finds it difficult to find work. Two years ago after her second child was born, she became very ill-increasingly weak with a persistent cough. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis and had medication prescribed by the hospital. Several months later she was still coughing, had chest pains, was vomiting and had to lie down most of the time due to extreme weakness and numbness in her legs. Symptoms also included night sweats and a very poor appetite. Her mood was low and she often preferred to be alone, not interested in caring for her children. After her first homeopathic prescription from the Maun Homeopathy Project there was a noticeable improvement in all her symptoms: the vomiting stopped, the cough reduced and she felt stronger. Within 6 weeks she was well enough to return to her own home and look after her children again.</span></p>

<p>The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS estimates that between 260,000 and 350,000 people in Botswana live with HIV, including an estimated 14,000 children under 14. Approximately 120,000 children there have been orphaned by AIDS.</p>

<p>Botswana's National AIDS Coordinating Agency notes that the highest HIV prevalence in the country is in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Maun, for instance, is a town in northern Botswana of about 50,000 people particularly affected by the AIDS epidemic.</p>

<p>Although anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy is free to Botswana's citizens at 32 sites throughout the country, there is still a great need to attend to people suffering with the disease.</p>

<p>Hilary Fairclough, a British nurse and trained homeopath, started the Maun Homeopathy Project to treat HIV positive patients in Maun. Fariclough and the Maun Homeopathy Project use homeopathic treatments to relieve the ill-effects of trauma, shock, and grief among those impacted by AIDS deaths; improve physical and emotional health of HIV positive patients; and reduce distressing symptoms and side-effects of other AIDS treatments.</p>
<h3>Giving $10</h3>
<p>This month, 370 of us donated $3,700 to the Maun Homeopathy Project to fund their vital homeopathic medicines. This investment should provide enough medicines to treat up to 1,000 people in need! Thank you.</p>

<p>Homeopathic remedies are made from natural sources, mostly plants, minerals, and metals, which undergo a process of potentization. Homeopathy is safe medicine without risks of addiction, toxicity, or side-effects. It is a holistic system of healing which has been used globally for centuries.</p>

<p>In homeopathy, the person, not the disease, is treated. So, for instance, if someone is suffering from an itchy skin rash as a result of their antiretroviral therapy which is worse in the evenings and if this patient is also depressed and weepy, the homeopaths serving the Maun community might then offer the homeopathic medicine made from Pulsatilla nigrens (a plant from the ranunculacea family). This remedy will help to rebalance the body so that the skin rash is no longer produced.</p>

<p>The Maun project volunteers treat three categories of clients at their clinics (they also do home visits for those people who are too ill and poor to make it to a health center for treatment). They treat those individuals who are HIV positive but who are not yet taking anti-retroviral medicines. For them the homeopathy boosts their immune system and keeps them well for as long as possible. They also treat patients who are taking ARVs and who are suffering from side-effects such as skin rashes and sleeplessness, which homeopathy helps to reduce. Lastly, they treat those who are taking ARVs but still have troubling ailments such as persistent coughs, lack of appetite, depression and anxiety, numbness of the legs, or body pains.</p>

<p>The people treated in Maun are very poor and live in fear for themselves and their families. Fear of the misery that comes with AIDS. Fear of the loss that comes with AIDS. Thanks to the Maun Homeopathy Project, HIV positive Botswanans have a chance to feel well. They might be able to sleep at night in peace. They might be able to care for their families. They might be able to face a new day that otherwise would have seemed dismal. Thanks to you, 1,000 people have a brighter day ahead.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red;">PS. Please send in your April contribution right away! I can't do it without you!</span></strong></p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Report to The $10 Club</p>

<p>10.9.08</p>

<p>Thanks to the money donated by The $10 Club we have been able to treat more people by starting new Outreach Homeopathy Clinics for those people most in need in Maun, Botswana. In particular we have started new clinics in isolated villages within reach of Maun such as the village of Kareng. On this clinic day we get up with the sunrise, put our remedies, client notes and a packed lunch to share with everyone in our 4WD truck and set off. On the way we pick up Alex and Wasanapi, our homeopathy trainees who interpret for us at the clinics. It's a long drive and the last part is on a gravel road so it takes us nearly 3 hours to get there. Kareng village is a desolate place. There used to be a river running close by but it has dried up with the drought over the last 5 years. People still living in the village get by on some farming and government handouts. There is no electricity or phone connections. When we arrive we are greeted by the Chief and then we introduce ourselves to the nurses in the small clinic. They suggest we give an impromptu talk to the people waiting for treatment there so this is what we do, emphasising that homeopathy is a complementary medicine to be taken alongside the Anti-Retroviral Medicine prescribed by the Doctor. Then, after setting up our clinic in the "village hall", people who are living with HIV and AIDS queue patiently to be seen. Our work begins.</p>

<p>The cases we see there vary from mild skin rashes to mental or terminal illness. Because homeopathy is a medicine which treats the person not the disease itself, it is suitable and safe for everyone, regardless of age, illness or prescribed medications. There is no rush - we take our time to listen to everyone who comes for treatment. We don't just ask for information about the physical ailments but also any stresses, worries or sadness that people may be experiencing. Homeopathy is a holistic medicine so we take account of all aspects of a person's health and wellbeing. At the end of each consultation, again time is taken to decide on the prescription. We involve the trainees as much as possible in this so that they learn from the clinics as much as from their study course. The homeopathic medicines we prescribe last for 1 month.</p>

<p>After a short break, when we sit under the shade of a Mophane tree and eat our packed lunch, we continue the clinic. By 4pm we stop as we have a long journey home. In total we have treated 20 clients and have arranged to come back in a month's time. It is dark when we get back to Maun and we are tired but satisfied, knowing that we have completed a good day's work for people who are in desperate need.</p>

<p>We are now very well established in Maun and there is an outreach clinic every day Monday to Friday at a different location and in partnership with a different organisation. Clients hear about us through word of mouth and many are referred by the HIV Unit at the local hospital. Mondays and Thursdays we are based at The Lutheran Church close to the hospital. This is our biggest "walk-in" clinic. On the other days we do clinics at our other partner agencies for their clients - Maun Counselling Centre, Women Against Rape, Bana Ba Letsatsi (an organisation which supports street children) and Boseja HIV Support Group. Here people in the support group have written a song about how homeopathy has helped them and often we can hear them singing as we carry out the clinic.</p>

<p>Everyone who consults us receives a free homeopathic prescription for one month. This prescription acts by boosting the immune system so once well people don't need to keep taking the medicine. Often we experience people coming back for treatment after feeling well for 1-2 years following their initial course of homeopathy. Then it might be that they undergo a particular stress or trauma and their health relapses. This is when they come back to see us again for another prescription. It is heartening to hear how peoples' lives are transformed by our intervention "their lives are still hard but often they say "I feel better, homeopathy gives me the strength to carry on."</p>

<p>It is thanks to you as donors to The $10 Club that we have been able to continue our clinics for people living with HIV and AIDS in Maun, and prescribe the homeopathic medicines which contribute to making a positive difference to their lives. Thank you.</p>
