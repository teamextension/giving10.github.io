post-title: Human Development Foundation
post-summary: "$1,720 was given to the Human Development Foundation in Bangkok, Thailand, which runs the Mercy Centre. The money will be used to buy uniforms, shoes, sports clothing and sneakers, backpacks and school supplies, and fund field trips for 17 teenagers enrolling in a new literacy program operated by the Centre. These kids were orphaned, sold into the Thai sex trade, or subjected to other forms of abuse in their adolescent years. As a result of the new program, and the uniforms and supplies, they will have a sense of pride and self-respect, and a chance at a bright new future, armed with a valuable education. The Mercy Centre is embedded in Klong Toey, the worst slum area of Bangkok."
