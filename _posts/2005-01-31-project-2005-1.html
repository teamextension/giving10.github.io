post-title: Food for Life (Gokulam-Bhaktivedanta Children"s Home)
post-summary: $2,050 was given to Food for Life to support the Gokulam-Bhaktivedanta Children"s Home in Sri Lanka. The funds were used to purchase new beds, mattresses, and cupboards for up to 40 children, many of whom were displaced by the tsunami. The tsunami that struck Sri Lanka in December 2004 left many new orphans in its wake, compounding an already desperate situation. In response to this growing need, Gokulam resolved to construct additional buildings, with a goal of one day providing shelter for 250 children. Beyond providing basic necessities, Gokulam"s dedicated staff help the children achieve the self confidence, determination, and integrity to grow into adulthood as productive and successful world citizens. The staff attends to the children"s health providing three meals a day and regular exercise; the staff provides unconditional love to the children, many of whom have no family or have seen their families devastated by civil war, poverty, or natural disasters; and the staff provides education including technical and vocational training and the arts.
