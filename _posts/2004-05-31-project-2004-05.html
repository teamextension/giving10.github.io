post-title: New Hope Rural Leprosy Project
post-summary: "$1,610 was given to the New Hope Rural Leprosy Project in India to construct 10 brick row house units to provide waterproof and safe housing for people afflicted with leprosy. India is one of ten countries that has not been able to meet global leprosy elimination goals. In fact, India represents approximately three-quarters of the global leprosy burden with 473,658 new cases detected in 2002. The New Hope Rural Leprosy Trust undertakes more than a dozen programs including leprosy eradication, care of victims, health education, and immunization. The Director notes that the people he encounters with leprosy experience a loss of sensation in their fingers, hands, toes, and feet. Women burn their fingers while cooking, not feeling the heat. Men develop blisters while doing labor work and don't feel the pain."
