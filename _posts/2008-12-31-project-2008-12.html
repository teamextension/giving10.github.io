post-title: One Acre Fund
post-summary: $3,700 was given to One Acre Fund to provide the bundles of seed and fertilizer necessary for 37 Rwandan families (with more than 140 children in those families) to plant new, more profitable, crops. Roughly three out of four adults in Rwanda are classified as subsistence farmers. However, only one-fifth of households are considered to be "food secure". One Acre Fund field officers first organize women's groups in a rural area. The field officers then make small loans of farm inputs like seed and fertilizer (no cash is given; the loan is made "in-kind") to these groups and provide educational services to them. Upon harvest, the field officer collects a single repayment, and assists farmers in marketing their harvest.
