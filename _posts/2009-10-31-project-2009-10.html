<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your October 2009 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>The Republic of Moldova, landlocked between Romania and Ukraine in Eastern Europe, has experienced a rough transition since its 1991 independence from the former Soviet Union. It is one of the poorest countries in Europe with more than one-third of the population living below the poverty line.</p>

<p>Beginning of Life is an organization in Moldova working tirelessly to support women's health, fight HIV / AIDS, and care for girls rescued from the gruesome underground sex trafficking industry. They also provide medical and counseling services to pregnant women in the country. The group's goal is to restore the physical and emotional balance of at-risk individuals in Moldova.</p>

<p>They help vulnerable women through their pregnancies, but also support young unwed moms with counseling and baby provisions for 12 months, so their first year of life is a positive one.</p>
<h3>Giving $10</h3>
<p>This month, 340 of us joined together to donate $3,400 to Beginning of Life in Moldova to provide a full year's worth of food and hygiene products to nine vulnerable people in Moldova who were rescued from the streets, abandoned, or in dire conditions and are now served by the organization. Serghey Mihailov, Beginning of Life's director, expressed overwhelming gratitude when told we were considering a grant for their work, and now says it is </p> <blockquote>like a miracle as we were praying for help due to a shortfall of funds from other funding sources.</blockquote> <p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Beginning of Life serves HIV positive people and girls rescued from human trafficking networks. Serghey writes:</p>

<blockquote>Some find their way to the pregnancy clinic and other individuals we rescue from poor and unprotected families. All of them live in very awful and impoverished conditions. Health problems as a result of HIV infection make it impossible for them to keep their jobs and continue to work. Most of them receive some medical therapy through government programs but suffer from malnutrition and unsanitary environments.</blockquote>

<p>I have been asked to practice serious discretion in revealing the identities of the marginalized victims we are helping and their full plight so names are replaced with **. There is an obvious sensitivity to having this information broadcast too widely. But it is also important that you know a little about some of the people who you have rescued this month.</p>

<ul>
    <li>** realized that she is HIV positive in a pregnancy clinic. She escaped domestic violence with 3 children.</li>
    <li>** and her daughter are HIV positive. **'s husband died 2 years ago from AIDS. She cannot work because of health problems. Last year after a simple sickness, the child's immune system was compromised and the doctors detected AIDS. "We try to live normal life, even if it is very poor," ** says.</li>
    <li>** is HIV positive and he has severe health problems. Doctors detected a brain tumor. He is very weak and cannot work or support himself. His parents have died. He has an aunt, but she is scared by his sickness and fears taking him in. So he is alone.</li>
    <li>** suffers from epilepsy. In the pregnancy clinic she learned of her HIV positive state. Pregnancy and nervous stress led to frequent epileptic attacks. Her husband left her and she remains alone with her son and disability. She is living on a small disability payment.</li>
    <li>** grew up in an orphanage. When she finished school one rich man took her as a housekeeper. But after a time he sexually abused her. Later she gave birth to 2 daughters, but even then she remained a victim of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Social services attempted to intervene and ** and her 2 daughters escaped into the village to stay with her children.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moldova is also a country implicated in human trafficking. According to the US Association for International Migration, </p> <blockquote>Most victims from Moldova are sexually exploited, but there are cases of forced labor, forced begging, and organ removal... While anyone can fall victim to trafficking, in Moldova women, children and the disabled are especially vulnerable. Hoping to find a better life abroad and to help their families, many migrants are lured by false promises and trapped by traffickers.</blockquote> <p>William Finnegan, writing in the New Yorker, adds: </p> <blockquote>Foreign traffickers could buy a woman from a Moldovan recruiter for five hundred dollars, and sell her for five times that amount in a destination country.</blockquote>

<p>Five girls rescued from human trafficking are being helped by Beginning of Life and as a result of this month's grant, by you as well.</p>

<p><strong>PS. Thanksgiving is just around the corner. Please remember all of those who are less fortunate and make your November project donation right away!</strong></p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Please share our thank you very much to Ten Dollar Club for their kind heart and passion for poor people in Moldova! People, living with HIV/AIDS need support in different areas of their lives - spiritual, social, emotional, financial, etc. Our common ministry can give hope to many of them. We, staying in Moldova can help them with our advises, counseling, and friendship. Somehow we try to help them to realize themselves in society. You (from abroad) can pray for them and help them with your financial support. We see, how it works, and how different efforts serve to one goal.</p>

<p>We appriciate very much your support, please send our greetings to all people from your group, who gave money for this project.</p>

<p>We received money on Monday, and Thursday we bought food and items for the next month. This support is very meaningful for people, living with HIV/AIDS from 2 perspectives: 1- most of them are jobless, because of stigma, some of them were kicked out from their jobs, because bosses realized, that they are infected, some of them lost their jobs, because of the lack of food; and because of that any material support is vitally important for them; 2- nobody is interested in their lives, so any kind of support is not only a material support, it is a sign (or signal) for them, that they are important, that somebody is interested in them, that somebody think about them and pray for them.</p>

<p>Every Monday we have a prayer meeting, where we pray for our projects, for our beneficiaries, and for our partners (donors) also, so we are praying for you in a constant way.</p>

<p>May God bless you, and fill your needs.</p>

<p>Respectfully,<br />
Vladimir Ubeivolc</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: red;">October 2009 Grant Recipient:</span> Beginning of Life, Moldova, Report</strong></p>

<p>$3,400 was given to Beginning of Life in Moldova, a former soviet republic in Eastern Europe to support their work with HIV/AIDs and sex trafficking victims. Due to the confidentiality required to protect their identity, individual faces cannot be shared. The Ten Dollar Club grant has been used to purchase food packets, toiletries and personal care products. One U.S. Dollar is multiplied nearly 10-13 times in the country of Moldova and can provide material assistance to 10 victims for an entire year. These socially disadvantaged individuals, include single mothers, children and disabled men. HIV/AIDs victims are in serious need of constant and saturated diet, helping to maintain a stable level of the immune system. Your financial assistance can save these people from acute malnutrition and the deterioration of not only physical but also emotional and psychological health.</p>

<p>Moldova is also feeling the effects of the economic crisis and a sharp decline in living standards. Additionally the political crisis to attain power in the recent elections exacerbated an already volatile situation in the republic at the beginning of 2010. The population was primarily affected by a sharp increase in taxes for public utilities, prices for food, medicines and basic necessities. Also because of rising unemployment and the abolition of certain social benefits, many families stay on the brink of utter poverty and even starvation. Therefore, at the moment, socially unprotected parts of the population, and especially HIV/AIDs victims have acute needs for basic personal hygiene products and assistance for food.</p>

<p><span style="color: red;">We share two testimonies from people your giving has helped.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Svetlana: "I'm a single mother and with my young son we live in a rented old apartment. 8 years ago I received HIV infection from my husband. He died from AIDS a year ago. And now I'm trying to bring up my little son, thankfully, he escaped being infected. I'm working, but the salary is too small to cover all the expenses and needs for food, rent and all bills which now increased two to three times. My salary many times is detained several months, it's one of the ways businesses misuse their employees. In addition from the beginning of this year social welfare for the child of single mothers was canceled. It is clear that, this miserable 75 Moldovan lei ($6 US dollars per month) was not enough, but without it we struggle even more and living is even harder. And thank God, that exists such organizations as "Beginning of life" where we every month get a grocery bag and hygiene bag. Receiving this package, we are trying to stretch it for a month and so we survive in this difficult time. Without this help I with my baby would begin to starve, and then I probably wouldn't have strength to work and get the crumbs. So, good that there are still good people in this world."</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Constantine (26)</strong> Being HIV positive, he has hard health problems. Doctor detected brain tumor. He is very weak and cannot work, support himself. His parents died. Constantine has an aunt, but she is scared by his sickness and doesn't want to care about him:</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><blockquote>"I am absolutely hopeless. I have no strength to even go outside, so I keep lying in bed. But every time when the door of my room is opening Adelia (volunteer, social worker, "Beginning of life") and brings me food, I began to cherish hopes that all is not lost. Thank you."</blockquote></p>

<p>Beginning of Life is a non-government organization started for the love of God�s people especially the deprived and marginalized in society. "Beginning of Life" consists of 15 full and part time employees, including social workers, psychologist, social educators and graduates in other areas where BOL is ministering.</p>

<p>In addition to the core team, there are regularly about 60 volunteers that help in serving those in need. If we talk specifically about the program of assistance to people living with HIV, may be noted:</p>

<p><i>Yulia Ubeyvolk</i>, provides psychological counseling and carry on mutual support groups of people living with HIV. Bachelor and Master of Psychology, BTh<br />
<i>Natalia Klapanyuk,</i> social worker. Bachelor of Social Work (BSW), the student of M.S.W.<br />
<i>Irina Rotaru,</i> social worker, B.S.W.<br />
<i>Paul Poperechnyi,</i> BTh, MA, MDiv. Conducts spiritual lessons in a group of HIV<br />
<i>Adelia Kuliev,</i> volunteer, social worker, a student of the CTE, Social work faculty<br />
<i>Olga, CTE student,</i> social work faculty. holds Dramatherapy, volunteer<br />
<i>Svetlana Firsova,</i> volunteer, conducts art therapy.<br />
<i>Tatiana Demetieva,</i> volunteer.</p>

<p>We want to say this to the individuals who donated the money: People who have an opportunity this year to receive food packages know that they are not left in the lurch and alone, but God found good people "you" who want to share with them the warmth and richness of His love. Thank you!</p>
