post-title: Noor Ajab Khan and the Sarhad Rural Support Programme
post-summary: $2,230 was given to Noor Ajab Khan and the Sarhad Rural Support Programme to train traditional birth attendants in the northwest Pakistani region of Chitral. Our donation will train twenty local women in a six-day midwifery training session including transportation, housing, food, and training materials; fund two doctor trainers; and provide each of the women with a basic medical kit including vitamins, medicines, rehydration tablets, and appropriate medical instruments to facilitate childbirth. Leftover funds will supplement the kits when vitamins or medicines run out. In rural Pakistan, the conservative culture keeps women shielded from public view. Some men refuse to let their wives or other female relatives go outside the home for medical care, including during pregnancy and childbirth. As a result, one in 38 Pakistani women dies from pregnancy-related causes; almost one half of women there are anemic throughout their pregnancies; and 83 babies die per thousand births in Pakistan.
