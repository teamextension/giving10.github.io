post-title: Volunteer Peten
post-summary: "$1,270 was given to Volunteer Peten, an organization working in Guatemala. The money will buy textbooks, dictionaries, thesauri, and atlases for three classes in each of three different schools in La Union, Ixhuacut and El Tigre. Additionally, a photocopier, paper, toner, and book binding supplies will be attained to enable educators there to copy and share other papers for curent and future students in these and neighboring communities. While literacy levels are very low in Guatemala--far below the average for Latin America--and children have a difficult time staying in school, 180 children will be helped immediately as a result of this project and have a better chance at a quality education and life out of poverty.
