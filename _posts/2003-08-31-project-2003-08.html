post-title: Moiyet Women's Group
post-summary: "$850 was given to fund the construction of a rainwater catchment tank in Kenya through Waterlines. The proposal was presented by the Moiyet Women's Group in the Bomet region of Kenya southwest of Nairobi. The women's group consists of 20 members, ages 50-80, who have worked together since 1980. They requested $730 for a 30,000 liter rain collection tank of ferro-cement to be placed next to a flour mill that they have purchased as a cooperative. They will use the water for drinking as well as some processing of grain. At present they bring the water by donkey and more often, by human labor. Water-borne diseases are some of the health problems they now face that would be alleviated if the tank was in place. The group plans on raising 25% of the total cost. The remaining money will go toward a similar project in a neighboring village."
