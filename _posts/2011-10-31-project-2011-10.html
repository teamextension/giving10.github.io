<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your October 2011 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>The Kinkizi Rural Development Initiative Trust was started in 2007 by the youth of Bwindi in Mukono parish (Uganda) to unite their efforts in fighting poverty, hunger, illiteracy and malnutrition.</p>

<p>Their efforts began small with tree nurseries, vegetable gardens, and training community members in how to grow vegetables, including cabbage, spinach, carrots, green peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, onions, and zucchini. The bounty of their harvests was purchased by tourism camps in the area as well as local people for their sustenance. More than 45 people settled on productive farm areas, producing much-needed foods.</p>

<p>The project has grown steadily in the past few years and has trained more than 150 people in vegetable growing, employs 15 members of the community, and has helped 3 people to go back to school to further their studies both in high school and at the university level.</p>

<p>By all accounts, the project has been a great success. However, land is difficult to acquire, especially as the Trusts work continues to expand. The more available land, the more opportunities to grow vegetables to benefit the community. But the growers are also making sound business decisions, not just acquiring more land, but utilizing the land to grow the highest value crops, such as mushrooms.</p>

<h3>Giving $10</h3>
<p>This month, 250 of us donated $2,500 to the Kinkizi Rural Development Initiative Trust to purchase land for a community gardening project. This land will also include the space for construction of a store to sell vegetables, as well as a demonstration garden where budding farmers can learn sustainable gardening skills. Thank you.</p>

<p>According to John Bosco Tusingwire, a representative of the Trust, they are entering into a serious mushroom business. About 30 people have registered to get this special mushroom training at our mushroom gardens. We are determined to feed the world with high quality organic mushrooms. <blockquote>With our mushroom initiative we are expecting every member to be earning at least $150 per month; this is going to be a poverty chain-breaking project.</blockquote> They are even considering whether there would be export possibilities for their crops to further expand market opportunities.</p>

<p>The vision of the Trust is simple and clear:</p>
<blockquote>To be the leading door to door raw food production and delivery service in south western Uganda, known for quality, efficiency, reliability and customer satisfaction. This, in an effort to create a community that has the potential to use the available resources to be free from poverty, malnutrition and hunger and able to sustain its livelihoods.</blockquote>

<p>This month, you are a part of the solution for these small-scale, sustainable farmers in Uganda. Their climb out of poverty starts with your support and a mushroom garden.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>We the members of Kinkizi Rural Development Initiative trust (KIRUDI) are very jovial to communicate to you as a group purposely sending you a vote of thanks for donating to us money to buy a plot of land. It is very hard to see it by mere writing this letter but honestly our innermost hearts are now comfortable and not doubting of where we shall be next time, as it was before we had our own land, in short we are the happiest ones.</p>

<p>In Uganda land is now more precious than Gold especially here in Bwindi, therefore anyone who decides to give you land to farm in Bwindi have given you wealth for life.</p>

<p>Now that we have our own land as a group we are now focusing on permanent plans for sustainable use of our land, we are planning to put up measures that makes sustainable use of our small land for the goodwill of our present community and the future generation. Now that the land is small and strategically positioned we are planning high value crops that will benefit each of us both economically, socially and health wise. Enterprises like nursery bed of vegetables and coffee as well mushroom project are going to be established, the reason being that they occupy small space and give high yield in a short time, also we shall be getting seedling from our plot to go and plant in our home gardens.</p>

<p>We therefore again thank you to help us achieve this great resource which have been our dream for the last 5 years. Thank you for making us get established on our own property. We also send our inmost appreciation to those who contributed as we know this generous heart is not with everybody though they could be having even much to do anything. Please send our innermost thanks to them.</p>

<p>Like as you know we are still trying to establish ourselves we need much more help as you well know that reaching at a self-sustaining stage is not simple especially we the less privileged and marginalized women and men of the community.</p>

<p>We have attached a group photo for you to see those who are benefiting or going to benefit from the land and the entire project in general. You may not see us clearly because we took the photos after the meeting late in the evening. It was getting darker.</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br>Safari Joseph. <br>Chairman for and on the behalf of KIRUDI organization members.</p>
