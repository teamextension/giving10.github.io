<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your October 2011 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>The Kinkizi Rural Development Initiative Trust was started in 2007 by the youth of Bwindi in Mukono parish (Uganda) to unite their efforts in fighting poverty, hunger, illiteracy and malnutrition.</p>

<p>Their efforts began small with tree nurseries, vegetable gardens, and training community members in how to grow vegetables, including cabbage, spinach, carrots, green peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, onions, and zucchini. The bounty of their harvests was purchased by tourism camps in the area as well as local people for their sustenance. More than 45 people settled on productive farm areas, producing much-needed foods.</p>

<p>The project has grown steadily in the past few years and has trained more than 150 people in vegetable growing, employs 15 members of the community, and has helped 3 people to go back to school to further their studies both in high school and at the university level.</p>

<p>By all accounts, the project has been a great success. However, land is difficult to acquire, especially as the Trusts work continues to expand. The more available land, the more opportunities to grow vegetables to benefit the community. But the growers are also making sound business decisions, not just acquiring more land, but utilizing the land to grow the highest value crops, such as mushrooms.</p>

<p>This month, 250 of us donated $2,500 to the Kinkizi Rural Development Initiative Trust to purchase land for a community gardening project. This land will also include the space for construction of a store to sell vegetables, as well as a demonstration garden where budding farmers can learn sustainable gardening skills. Thank you.</p>

<p>According to John Bosco Tusingwire, a representative of the Trust, they are entering into a serious mushroom business. About 30 people have registered to get this special mushroom training at our mushroom gardens. We are determined to feed the world with high quality organic mushrooms. <blockquote>With our mushroom initiative we are expecting every member to be earning at least $150 per month; this is going to be a poverty chain-breaking project.</blockquote> They are even considering whether there would be export possibilities for their crops to further expand market opportunities.</p>

<p>The vision of the Trust is simple and clear:</p>
<blockquote>To be the leading door to door raw food production and delivery service in south western Uganda, known for quality, efficiency, reliability and customer satisfaction. This, in an effort to create a community that has the potential to use the available resources to be free fromï¿½poverty, malnutrition and hunger and able to sustain its livelihoods.</blockquote>

<p>This month, you are a part of the solution for these small-scale, sustainable farmers in Uganda. Their climb out of poverty starts with your support and a mushroom garden.</p>

<p>Saving the world, ten dollars at a time,</p>
<p>Adam</p>
