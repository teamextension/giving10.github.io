<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your July 2009 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>Steven Nzirorera lost both of his parents in 1994. He works hard at school, is obedient, and helps others. Ufitinema Elie is only 5. She lost both of her parents to AIDS. She likes playing ball and with toy cars. Jean de Dieu Ngirabaganwa is 15 years old. He studies hard, prays, and wants to become a doctor or a pilot. Jean notes that his personal struggle is <blockquote>just that I have no family and a difficult life at school.</blockquote></p>

<p>The 1994 Rwandan genocide left behind hundreds of thousands of orphans. Parents succumbing to AIDS have created hundreds of thousands more. These vulnerable children struggle to get by, clinging to a bare existence. In addition, an estimated 100,000 households are headed by children. So many young people living on the edge.</p>

<p>And across Rwanda, small orphanages run by compassionate people do their best to make an impact for young people in need.</p>

<p>The Gisimba Memorial Center (GMC) is one such facility, nestled in the District of Nyarugenge. It started in the Gisimba family's home in the 1970s and has survived from grandfather to son to grandson. Starting with 18 children GMC today is home to more than 180 children in need. Some are infected with HIV. Five are mentally ill. Four are deaf.</p>

<p>The orphanage is not just a place of healing, education, and safety, but was also created as a training center including, for instance, craft training to teach children a marketable skill. Kids at Gisimba need school fees, medical care, clothes, and a balanced diet.</p>

<p>This month, 350 of us joined together to donate $3,500 to the Gisimba Memorial Center to provide more than a month's worth of meals to the residents there three meals a day, seven days a week, for nearly 200 kids. Our funds will provide flour for porridge, tea, sugar, potatoes, cassava, rice, sweet potatoes, bananas and other fruits, beans, bulgur, maize flour, wheat flour, oil, and powdered milk. Thank you.</p>

<p>On Monday, as we all start the work week anew, 180 kids in Rwanda will have their morning porridge; followed by a lunch of Irish potatoes, beans, and vegetables; and then for dinner, bulgur, beans and vegetables. They will have those three meals because of your $10 donation. And on Tuesday, Wednesday, and throughout the rest of the week, the meals will continue being served, without fail, because of the generosity of strangers.</p>
