post-title:  Batsiranai Craft Project
post-summary: "$2,220 was given to the Batsiranai Craft Project, an organization in Oregon working to support the Epworth Group. The Epworth Zimbabwe Parents of Disabled Children Group is made up of 34 mothers and their children. Currently the Epworth members do not have a successful income generation scheme. Last year the members attempted to create a garden project, but since there is no city water supplied to the property the project was unsuccessful. Water must be obtained by hand dug shallow wells or boreholes. Most of the hand dug wells are non-functional during the summer season as the water drops below well level. Our funds will be used to drill a bore hole with pump and piping to allow the Epworth Group to introduce several projects for the benefit of the women, their children and extended families. The Epworth community is made up of unemployed and marginally employed families living under extremely harsh and challenging circumstances. The Epworth members come together to act as a support group, to assist with the care of their severely disabled children, and to work together on income generation projects. All of the families are poor and struggling to make ends meet. Having a disabled child is considered evidence of evil actions and reflects badly on the mother in particular, and on the family in general.

In addition to managing the medical and educational needs of the disabled children, the families have a daily struggle for basic needs of food, housing and clothing. Our grant will enable the Epworth Group to:
Plant, cultivate, harvest, and process Moringa trees. Moringa is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals especially Calcium and Vitamin A. The leaves, green pods and flowers can be cooked as vegetables. The leaves may be dried and made into a powder to sprinkle into soups and stews. Moringa products can be sold locally for income generation.
Plant Jatropa trees around the perimeter of the property. Jatropa seeds are used in soap production which will create yet another income project. Jatropa trees are also nitrogen fixers, thus synergistic with permaculture gardening.

Establish a permaculture vegetable garden which is enhanced when grown in a Moringa and Jatropa orchard. Vegetables cultivated can be used by the group as well as sold locally."
