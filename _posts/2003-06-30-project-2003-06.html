post-title: South East Asian Children's Assistance Project (SEACAP)
post-summary: "$870 was given to the South East Asian Children's Assistance Project (SEACAP), operating a Center for orphaned and disabled children in Vietnam, to fund a part-time doctor to tend to the children there for one full year, a painting teacher for six months, and the salary of the caretaker of the Deaf School during the summer holiday period, and for electricity and minor repairs at the Deaf School during these 3 months. As a result, about 200 kids will have access to vital health care and some artistic pleasure, which also incorporates a vocational skill. The Nguyen Nga Vocational Establishment for Orphans and Disabled Persons in Quy Nhon is run by Nguyen Nga. Concerning the need for the part-time doctor, Ms. Nguyen Nga told me: Up until now, we have not been able to employ a doctor, due to lack of funds, but it would be very good for our students if we could employ a part-time doctor who could visit our center on a regular basis (as it is difficult for most of our students to take themselves to the doctor), to care for the health of our students. At the moment, when the students go to the hospital, they always see a different doctor and there is no continuity of care. As I'm sure you can imagine, health care is of primary importance, particularly to disabled people, who are more prone to ill-health than able-bodied people."
