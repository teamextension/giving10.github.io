post-title: Needy Hospice
post-summary: "$1,830 was given to the Needy Hospice outside Arusha, Tanzania to feed roughly 70 people for a period of nine weeks. This is a pivotal time for full food service as patients will be receiving seminars about HIV/AIDS, transmission, prevention, societal stigma, and nutrition. This grant will buy cooking oil, rice, wheat flour, oranges, potatoes, carrots, garlic, green beans, soybeans, peanuts, and maize flour, all from a local farm and local markets. Needy Hospice is a voluntary non-profit organization founded in 1988 to serve the terminally ill, particularly individuals who are HIV positive, including patients whose illness has progressed to the advanced stages of AIDS. A remarkable number of people in this region suffer and die from starvation and nutritional deficiencies. Patrick, a volunteer with the Hospice, tells me that although terminally ill patients are too often neglected and overlooked when it comes to healthcare services, especially those stricken with HIV/AIDS he believes that by serving this community we can help to lift the rampant stigma of HIV/AIDS in Tanzania, better the quality of life, and ease some of the suffering these patients experience."
