post-title: Gauteng Alliance
post-summary: "$900 was given to the Gauteng Alliance for Street Children in Johannesburg, South Africa to fund the purchase of first aid kits and blankets for affiliated shelters there that take in and rehabilitate street children. These children's parents have died of HIV/AIDS, are addicted to drugs, are in prison; they are kids who have been raped and beaten, forced to live on the streets, seemingly hopeless. Now they might have some glimmer of hope. The first aid kits contain basic first aid tools such as plasters, bandages, gloves, cough mixtures, antiseptic fluid for cuts, scissors, cotton wool swabs, splints, etc. In the coming months, children we'll never meet who live 9,000 miles away from us will be taken in by compassionate people and their wounds will be healed, their ailments remedied, and it will all be because we each decided to spare $10 this month."
