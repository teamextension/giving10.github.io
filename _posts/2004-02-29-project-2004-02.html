post-title: Born Free Foundation Global Friends Program
post-summary: "$1,300 was given to the Born Free Foundation Global Friends Program to fund the construction and delivery of 8 desks and 80 chairs to students at the Ngaga School in Uganda. Before Born Free's support of the school, each class had a blackboard suspended from their class tree. When it rained, kids would be forced to scurry for shelter in a nearby church. Now, a building has been constructed and the number of children attending the school has doubled. Before The $10 Club's support of the school, each class used make-shift panels of wood atop bricks for benches and had no desks. Now, desks and chairs will be available, enabling the children the opportunity to work in groups and provide a more positive learning environment. Uganda ranks in the bottom one-fifth of the nations of the world on the United Nations Human Development Index. One-third of Ugandan adults over age 15 are illiterate."
