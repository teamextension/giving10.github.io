post-summary: "$1,030 was given to Project Concern International to assist in the prevention of malaria by purchasing and distributing Insecticide Treated Bed Nets to vulnerable women and children in the Ghanian districts of Wassail West and Wassail Amenfi. Currently, only 29% of households have these nets and only 19% of the nets are in good condition without holes. As a result, approximately 178 families will receive these protective nets and reduce the risk of debilitation or death from this preventable disease. Today, as many as 7,000 people, mostly children, die every day from malaria. According to Project Concern International, Malaria is the number one killer of children under five in Ghana, and the highest cause of morbidity among pregnant women. In children under five years, 44.3% of all diseases are due to malaria while it contributes to 22% of under-five mortality. Malaria causes one in ten deaths among pregnant women in this West African nation."
