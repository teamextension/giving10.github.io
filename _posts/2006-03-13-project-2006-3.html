post-title: Shan Orphan Support
post-summary: "$2,910 was given to Shan Orphan Support on the Thai / Burma border to support their school-based health centers by providing teacher/nurse training, medical and dental supplies, and personal hygiene items including soap and shampoo. We also provided all the orphans with sandals for their feet. The teacher/nurse will assume duties regarding simple health and dental care for the kids in coordination with the village nurse. Approximately 1,000 children (including 300 orphans) currently reside in three different camps for internally displaced people along the border between Thailand and the Shan State in Burma. Some of the children in these camps are former child soldiers who fought to avenge their parents and have since been disarmed and enrolled in school. Others are victims of violence who saw their parents murdered and villages burned, and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorders. Still others are victims of sexual violence. The children are suffering from many common childhood illnesses and hygiene issues that are exacerbated by lack of resources - sore throats, earaches, fevers, coughs, septic wounds and scrapes, rashes, cuts, and sprains. We'll help provide the children with dozens of vital medicines and supplies including penicillin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, antifungal and antibacterial creams, vitamins, calamine lotion, rubbing alcohol, bandages, etc. Many diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS) require long-term treatments and are sensitive to reliable application of medicine - lack of oversight is a serious problem. We'll help ensure that there is proper supervision of medical treatments so they can be applied consistently."

<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your March 2006 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>Approximately 1,000 children (including 300 orphans) currently reside in three different camps for internally displaced people along the border between Thailand and the Shan State in Burma. Some of the children in these camps are former child soldiers who fought to avenge their parents and have since been disarmed and enrolled in school. Others are victims of violence who saw their parents murdered and villages burned, and suffer from posttraumatic stress disorders. Still others are victims of sexual violence.</p>

<p>Burma's repressive military regime has engaged in brutal ethnic cleansing as part of a war against the ethnic states in Burma including the Shan. It is illegal in Burma to teach the Shan language, history, or culture, and no schooling is allowed in parts of the rural countryside. Eighty percent of Shans receive no education at all. Teachers risk prison, torture and death.</p>

<p>Shan Orphan Support (SOS) was created at the request of southern Shan leaders to promote awareness of the Shan situation and help get support for Shan children. SOS has worked hard to initiate and expand School-Based Health Centers serving displaced people and refugees along the Thailand/Shan State, Burma border. In addition to schooling, these centers deliver preventive and curative medical, dental, and mental healthcare services to underserved children.</p>

<p>This month 291 of us gave $2,910 to SOS to support the health centers by providing teacher/nurse training, medical and dental supplies, and personal hygiene items including soap and shampoo. We'll also provide all the orphans with sandals for their feet. The teacher/nurse will assume duties regarding simple health and dental care for the kids in coordination with the village nurse. Thank you.</p>

<p>Todd Jones of SOS tells me "Your sponsorship will launch the program and build the foundation for good things to come. I'm sure there are many good causes that deserve your help, but what you do with us will break ground where few have gone." Thanks to you, The $10 Club is going to fund a critical preliminary component of SOS's long-term strategy and we will be a catalyst for the sustainable development of this vital project.</p>
