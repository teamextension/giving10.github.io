post-title:  Women Prisoners Support Organization
post-summary: $2,550 was given to the Women Prisoners Support Organization to provide women and children with insecticide-treated bednets in Uganda. The nets cost $5 each and will be treated twice in the coming year at a cost of $3 per treatment. Thus, roughly 230 people will have a potentially life-saving net to sleep under. "Malaria is a leading killer of children under five and a major contributor to adult morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa," according to the Global Health Council, and it "disproportionately affects people living in poverty." In Uganda specifically, the most recent Human Development Report reveals that more than half of all people who fell sick in the county did so as a result of malaria. The Uganda Ministry of Health appears determined to fight malaria within the country, and has set a goal of at least having all children under five and pregnant women sleeping under insecticide-treated bednets. These nets are one of the most cost-effective ways to avoid the mosquito bites that transmit the disease. This grant to provide the nets is so important in Uganda, where the percentage of pregnant women with malaria infection in prisons can be as high as 65%. According to WPSO, "pregnant women offenders in malaria endemic areas such as Uganda often do not receive adequate preventative and curative care contributing to avoidable and unacceptably high numbers of maternal and infant deaths in prison."
