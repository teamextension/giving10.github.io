post-title: CAMFED International
post-summary: "$1,920 was given to CAMFED International to establish a specific 'Safety-Net Fund' for more than 100 poor girls in the Chikomba District of Zimbabwe, providing immediate and flexible support to girls lacking resources to attend school. The Chikomba Community District Committee will help identify children with specific needs and, in consultation with CAMFED's representatives in Zimbabwe, ensure that these tailored educational needs are met. The $10 Club Safety-Net Fund could mean providing one girl with pens or exercise books costing around a dollar, allowing her to return to school the following day, or providing a full bursary of around eighteen dollars to pay examination fees, buy uniforms, shoes, stationary, or sanitary items. In some cases, this will mean a student is able to attend school for the first time."
