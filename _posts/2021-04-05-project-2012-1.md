post-title:  "2. Hôpital Albert Schweitzer Haiti"
post-summary: "$2,250 was given to Hôpital Albert Schweitzer Haiti (HAS) to install nearly 50 new Biosand water filters in high-need households in the Pont Sondé area in the Artibonite Valley of Haiti. To address the root causes of diarrhea and malnutrition, and now cholera which emerged in epidemic proportions in Haiti in 2010, HAS has focused on community health and development activities, including drilling wells and providing sanitation, which have allowed many families to have access to clean drinking water and latrines."
