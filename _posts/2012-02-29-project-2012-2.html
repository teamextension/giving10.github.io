<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your February 2012 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>Since 1996, the Visakha Society for the Protection and Care of Animals (VSPCA) has worked to improve the conditions for animals in India, protecting endangered sea turtles, rescuing cows, and providing housing to dogs, cats, and other animals in need.</p>

<p>Throughout India, there is a connection between stray dogs and cats and impoverished people living on the streets. Homeless people in India might be emotionally traumatized, mentally disabled, or in other ways infirm. The bond these people develop with animals is strong and often an easier relationship than would be possible with people.</p>

<p>According to Pradeep Kumar Nath, VSPCA's Founder and President: "In reality they are seeking each other's company to strike a bond of love and affection after being abandoned by their own society and now are building a relationship of life. ... a life is a life and is not related to physical appearance."</p>

<p>In January 2010, VSPCA began a plan to deliver vegan meals to India's poor humans living on the streets. Called the "Kindness Mobile Restaurant," roughly eighty people are served weekly in three different areas. A wholesome and nutritious vegan meal (lentils, vegetable curry, fruit and one sachet of drinking water) is hygienically packed in palm leaves and provided by auto-rickshaw to the poorest of the poor three days a week (when other charities in the area are not operating).</p>

<h3>Giving $10</h3>

<p>This month, 246 of us joined together to donate $2,460 to the Visakha Society for the Protection and Care of Animals in India to provide 5,000 food packets to homeless people in need serving dozens of people three times a week for an entire year. Thank you.</p>

<p>Nath writes: "Every one of them has a trusted association with a street dog. They give the first morsel of food to the dog that comes at that time to get their first share. Both the poor person and the street dog have both overcome loneliness in having each other as companions."</p>

<p>India has some 1.2 billion people, 30% of whom live in urban areas. 237 million people or one in five are malnourished. Nearly half of India's children are malnourished to the point of being underweight and having their growth stunted. The breadth of the problem is overwhelming. But for about 80 of the poorest of the poor in the country, for the rest of the year, food insecurity will not be a problem thanks to your small sacrifice this month!</p>

<p>Saving the world, ten dollars at a time,</p>
<p>Adam</p>
