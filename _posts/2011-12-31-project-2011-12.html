post-title: SUUBI Community Development Initiative
post-summary: "$2,380 was given to the SUUBI Community Development Initiative to help care for 20 orphans in need. Our grant helped the group pay for the school fees for these children, outfit them with school uniforms and casual wear including shoes, provide them with mattresses and bedding and blankets, and make sure they have necessary food to take them through the school terms. Butuntumula is a sub-county of the Luwero District in Uganda with approximately 35,000 people. People in the community travel miles to get access to moderately safe drinking water. The elderly, including those suffering from blindness and other debilitations, have to care for children who have lost their parents. Most orphaned children are unable to attend school and some have to work in local markets selling fish while simultaneously looking after their younger siblings."

<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your December 2011 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>The citizens of Uganda continue to suffer from poverty, locked in the lowest third of ranked nations in the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Index (161 out of 187). Average life expectancy at birth is 54. Ugandans have to worry about cholera, malaria, and AIDS. AIDS is especially traumatic on families, taking parents away from their children forever. There are estimated to be more than two million orphans in the country today.</p>

<p>These children need to rely on some form of health and education services in order to meet their basic needs. And, of course, the government is ill-equipped to fully handle the situation. They often end up living with relatives who have their own children already and are therefore unable to care for their new residents fully. Children often subsist on a single meal each day.</p>

<p>Butuntumula is a sub-county of the Luwero District in Uganda with approximately 35,000 people. People in the community travel miles to get access to moderately safe drinking water. The elderly, including those suffering from blindness and other debilitations, have to care for children who have lost their parents. Most orphaned children are unable to attend school and some have to work in local markets selling fish while simultaneously looking after their younger siblings.</p>

<p>There are 26 schools in the sub-county serving more than 10,000 students. But orphaned children have an extremely difficult time attending school. Even if enrolled, they need to find a way to acquire food, books, pens, clothes (school uniforms), and other materials necessary to fulfill their education. There is a local community development initiative in Butuntumala run by John Paul Kibalama that aims to assist the orphaned children there with food, provisions, school fees, and educational needs.</p>

<h3>Giving $10</h3>
<p>This month, 238 of us joined together to donate $2,380 to the SUUBI Community Development Initiative to help care for 20 orphans in need. Our grant will help the group pay for the school fees for these children, outfit them with school uniforms and casual wear including shoes, provide them with mattresses and bedding and blankets, and make sure they have necessary food to take them through the school terms. Thank you.</p>

<p>For children who have to literally walk miles to school, who lack proper clothing and adequate, nutritious food, and who have already lost so much in their young lives, your support this month has given them a chance to thrive.</p>
