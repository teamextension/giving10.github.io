post-title: Melissa Cosgrove Children's Foundation
post-summary: $2,150 was given to the Melissa Cosgrove Children's Foundation to assist in the renovation of a Burmese orphanage to include a library and school program. Our contribution funded 2 sets of school uniforms for each of the 18 children there; school bags with stationary, writing books, pens, and pencils; and a generator to provide power to the facility. This orphanage in Burma is located in the small city of Letpadan, a three-hour drive from Rangoon. Most of the children there are poor, uneducated, and lacking in self-esteem. The Burmese government supported the home when it was initially built in 1962, but quickly removed support leaving the school without wages for staff. The children there have never had new clothes or items for schooling. Burma is one of the poorest countries in Asia. According to an October 2004 report by the United Kingdom government's Department for International Development, "Public investment in education and healthcare combined is less than $1 per person each year - one of the lowest levels in the world." Further, the report notes, "Only 40% of children complete five years of primary education," and the quality of schooling is "undermined by under-investment in the crumbling public education system."
