<p>The Sunnyside Environmental School in Oregon incorporated Giving $10 into the school curriculum, enabling students to do research on poverty alleviation and make recommendations on projects worthy of our support. Here, the class engages in a conference call with Giving $10 President Adam Roberts to discuss their findings.</p>
<p>What the kids at Sunnyside said about their project:</p>
<blockquote>One thing that I really got out of all the researching was that I learned a lot about all the conflicts in the world that I was not aware of. When I did the research for Giving $10 it was a powerful experience.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Now that I'm aware of what I can do, I'm encouraged to help out more people in the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>After doing all this work, I feel like I have made more of a link with other people. Learning what kind of assistance poor communities (especially in Africa) need helps me realize what life is like for them.</blockquote>
