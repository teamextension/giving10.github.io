post-title: Project Ruth
post-summary: "$850 was given to Project Ruth, a group that works to ensure that disadvantaged children in Romania get an education. The money will be used to fund the distribution of toothbrushes and toothpaste to each of the 165 children at the Ruth School as well as the 200 children at other centers affiliated with Project Ruth in Romania and Moldova. If there is any money left over they will buy some soap for the children to use. Ellen Sechrest, who coordinates much of the activity for the organization here in the United States, writes: You would be amazed at how excited children get over a new toothbrush and the chance to wash their face. This is what I mean when I say that it's terribly easy for us to take things for granted. Ellen continues: The Health and Hygiene Center began about 3 years ago at the Ruth School. A friend of mine from Georgia went to Romania with me and was moved to action because of the dirtiness of the children and poor dental care. The Ruth School was plagued with lice and sickness because of unclean children. The children get to wash their faces and brush their teeth every day. Since over 95% of the children do not have running water this is a major event in their lives."
