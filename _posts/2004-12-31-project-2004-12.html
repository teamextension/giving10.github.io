post-title: POWER International's Co-operative Orthotic and Prosthetic Enterprise (COPE)
post-summary: "$2,000 was given to POWER International's Co-operative Orthotic and Prosthetic Enterprise (COPE) in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) to fit 20 people with artificial limbs. Laos is one of the nations most heavily littered with unexploded ordnances. Health care facilities in Laos are limited, making rehabilitation for landmine survivors, many of whom live in remote areas, difficult. According to the United Nations Mine Action Service, since 1975 there have been some 11,000 mine-related casualties in Laos. Currently, a minimum of 150 accident casualties are reported each year, but the actual number is surely much higher. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines' 2004 Landmine Monitor Report adds that some 37 percent of Laos's land area is at risk from unexploded ordnance, with more than 12,000 square kilometers considered \"high risk.\""
