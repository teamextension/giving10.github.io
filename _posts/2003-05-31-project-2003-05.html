post-title: Bansang Hospital
post-summary: "$800 was given to the Bansang Hospital Appeal to purchase and dispense vital medicines in The Gambia. It's simply unacceptable that that a hospital can run out of antibiotics and infants can go without vitamin-rich formula. In a world where Malaria claims more lives than AIDS, children go untreated. It does not have to be this way. Anita Smith, who runs the appeal for the hospital, tells me that The currency of The Gambia is currently worth one third of its value of two years ago. This means that the hospital has had a catastrophic reduction in basic drugs. Your donation to the Bansang Hospital Appeal is a timely one, as we can use it to address this terrible situation. We in the West take antibiotics for granted, but in Africa they are precious and save lives every day. At current prices your donation will allow 6,000 children to have a full course of treatment without which they would inevitably die."
