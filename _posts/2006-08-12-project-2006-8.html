post-summary: "$3,300 was given to the World Hope Foundation in Nigeria to provide 197 children at a nursery and primary school operating at the entrance to the Destitute Refugee Camp, run by the Salvation Army, with uniforms, notebooks, pens and pencils, drawing books, rulers, and other school supplies-enough to last a full year. These supplies will go a long way toward fulfilling their educational needs. As students will start their studies again in the first week of September, this grant is particularly timely. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, but also ranks among the world's poorest, ranking at 158 (out of 177) on the United Nations Human Development Index. Life expectancy in the country is 43 years old and average per capita income is less than $3 a day. The vast majority of Nigerians, however, earn far less than that. "

<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>Welcome to your August 2006 report for The $10 Club.</p>

<p>Hajji Monsour is nine years old. He arrived at the Destitute Refugee Camp in Nigeria in 2003 after his father was killed in the religious conflict in northern Nigeria. My mother is a blind woman, he writes, and our only source of living is begging for money in the streets of Lagos. I used to follow my mother around to beg for money because there is no means for me to attend school. I would like to be educated like other children.</p>

<p>Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, but also ranks among the world's poorest, ranking at 158 (out of 177) on the United Nations Human Development Index. Life expectancy in the country is 43 years old and average per capita income is less than $3 a day. The vast majority of Nigerians, however, earn far less than that.</p>

<p>In 1997, the World Hope Foundation (WHF) was established to provide humanitarian relief to those individuals and families devastated by poverty, illness, natural disasters, and conflict. Nigeria is home to hundreds of thousands of people displaced internally by land conflicts, religious fighting, and ethnic clashes. Countless refugees from neighboring African countries join dislocated Nigerians in refugee camps such as Destitute.</p>

<p>These refugees and internally displaced people suffer from poor environmental conditions, food shortages, substandard or non-existent health care, lack of potable water and sanitation facilities, and deficient educational opportunities for refugee children.</p>

<p>There is currently a nursery and primary school operating at the entrance to the Destitute Refugee Camp, run by the Salvation Army. Children there range from 2 to 13 years old, and they are taught English, math, science, social studies, and arts and crafts.</p>

<h3>Giving $10</h3>

<p>This month, 330 of us joined together to donate $3,300 to the World Hope Foundation to provide 197 children at the school with uniforms, notebooks, pens and pencils, drawing books, rulers, and other school supplies enough to last a full year. These supplies will go a long way toward fulfilling their educational needs. As students will start their studies again in the first week of September, this grant is particularly timely. Thank you.</p>

<p>Poor Africans, especially in Nigeria, need so much help and, although our resources are limited, I'm very pleased that we were able to assist them in this modest way. Being educated will dramatically improve the chances that these children will someday climb out of their current destitution. And when that day comes, it will be in large part due to your generosity.</p>
