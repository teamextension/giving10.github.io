post-title: Engineers Without Borders
post-summary: $2,140 was given to Engineers Without Borders to implement a rainwater catchment system in the Muramba community of Rwanda. Our funds were used to provide a 10,000 liter prefabricated tank, corrugated sheet metal, plastic, roofing tiles, nails, tar/caulk, wire screen mesh, cement, sand and gravel, locally made bricks, two by fours, taps, and pipes. Now up and running, the tank allows water to be collected for drinking, bathing, and irrigation. Muramba suffered greatly by the violent Rwandan conflict of the early 1990s between the Hutus and Tutsis. The community's water system was among the most damaged aspects of the area"s infrastructure, leaving contaminated water with a high risk of E. coli and other diseases. The $10 Club has provided this community with a safe water supply.
