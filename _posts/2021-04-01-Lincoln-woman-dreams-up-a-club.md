post-title:  Lincoln woman dreams up a club worth joining, the Kind Neighbor Society
post-summary: Rosemary Ohles (in white) and others gather March 25 for a candlelight vigil hosted by the Asian Community and Cultural Center remembering the victims of a recent shooting in Atlanta. The vice president of the Asian Center's board of directors came up with an annual "giving society" to support its work.

When Rosemary Ohles came up with the idea of the Kind Neighbor Society, she thought people might want to honor a kind neighbor of their own — someone who had been kind to refugees and immigrants in Lincoln — when they donated their way into membership.

And some of them did.

“Because kind neighbors make a difference,” a donor wrote, before honoring one kind neighbor and memorializing another.

But most of those who donated to the Kind Neighbor Society and its beneficiary — the Asian Community and Cultural Center — mentioned the same neighbor.

The recipient of their dollars.

We love the Asian Center and are proud to support …

This donation is to say we stand with the Asian Community in Lincoln. Cultural diversity is a gift that should be celebrated …

We see you, we support you, and we are here for you …

Ohles and her fellow board members set a modest goal when they launched the campaign three weeks ago: $15,000.

They are getting close to that number, and they would be happy to soar above it. (If you would be so kind.)
