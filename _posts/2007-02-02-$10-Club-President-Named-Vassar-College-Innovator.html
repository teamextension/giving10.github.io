<h3>Saving the World Ten Dollars at a Time</h3>

<p>In the summer of 2002, Adam Roberts '90 attended the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa where, for over a week, he was bombarded with the evidence of increasing poverty the world over. As he listened to global leaders discuss the plight of the world's poor, he came up with an idea: The $10 Club.</p>

<p>Roberts and his wife both work for nonprofits and give generously to several charitable organizations, but they're not Bill and Melinda Gates; they don't have unlimited financial resources. " As an individual I'm limited in the resources I can bring to the table for poverty eradication, but I concluded that if I could start by getting 100 people in my similar situation to give $10 a month, together we could make a direct difference of $1,000 to someone, to some group of people, somewhere in the world."</p>

<p>On December 18, 2002, Roberts sent a letter to friends, family and colleagues urging them to help him be a part of the solution, and the $10 Club was born.</p>

<p>Club members contribute $10 (tax-deductible) each month, and that money is pooled with all the other contributors' money, and 100% is used to fund a poverty alleviation project in a developing country. Roberts administers the club, but does not draw any remuneration. For the first two-and-a-half years, all costs associated with running the organization came out of his pocket. Now, foundation grants and additional member contributions help underwrite operational expenses. "The mission of the $10 Club is to lift people out of poverty wherever we can across the globe."</p>

<p>As of this writing, the club has approximately 300 members and has undertaken 39 projects (totalling more than $60,000) in 34 countries. To mention just a few: blankets, mattresses, pillows, and bedcovers at a new community center and home for the elderly in Tibet; health care for children and workers for one year at a children's center in Vietnam; insecticide-treated bed nets to vulnerable families in Ghana; a generator and cribs to an orphanage in Freetown, Sierra Leone; 10 brick housing units at a leper colony in India; prosthetic limbs for 20 amputees in Laos; sewing machines and garment making supplies for a women's cooperative in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
