post-title: Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund
post-summary: "$1,780 was given to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund to support two projects run by indigenous groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo. One project, operated by a local group called the Pole-Pole Foundation, is a sewing cooperative to enable local women to make dresses, shirts, and other garments for sale, thus generating their own source of sustainable income. The other, the Association de Femmes pour la Conservation et la Developpment Durable, promotes sustainable agriculture. Rebel soldiers recently ransacked the sewing project, destroying machines and stealing material, while more than 100 women were brutally attacked and raped. The $10 Club grant will provide eight new sewing machines, fabric, scissors, needles, pins, chalk and other items to help reconstruct the sewing project, and provide transport and other expenses for three women to receive victim support training and learn rape counseling techniques from Doctors on Call for Service, which they can then administer to other women."
