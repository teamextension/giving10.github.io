post-title: Scheer Memorial Hospital
post-summary: "$1,790 was given to Scheer Memorial Hospital in Nepal to purchase an air compression system for the Intensive Care Unit ventilators, thereby ensuring that life-saving care is administered to the patients in need. Currently, pumping oxygen into patients manually is not adequately regulated and does not enable the patient to be stabilized sufficiently. Scheer receives trauma and acute medical cases by the busloads; installation of an air compression system to their ventilators will enable patients to be stabilized and have their lives saved. Some patients walk for days to get to the hospital; others are carried by friends or family members on homemade stretchers or even by 'piggyback'. Despite overwhelming poverty in the region, no one is ever turned away from Scheer for lack of money over 35% of the cases there are charity cases, and most of the hospital's equipment and labor are donated."
