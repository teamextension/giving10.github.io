post-title: Christina Noble Children's Foundation
post-summary: $2,100 was given to the Christina Noble Children's Foundation to create a gymnasium in the Children's Prison in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Through the Foundation's work in Mongolia, specifically in the prison, they provide children with an education that most of them would not otherwise receive, while giving them the support, dignity, and respect that all children deserve. With our grant, we bring some relief to these children, assisting in their physical and psychological development. In this facility there is little stimulation for the children and, therefore, little to aid their rehabilitation. Now, they will have physical exercise despite the harsh Mongolian climate, health education classes, and exercise programs. The $10 Club provides renovation costs for the exercise room as well as a wall mirror, shelves, posters, multi-way exercise machine, two stomach muscle machines, stationary bike, treadmill, bench press, weights, power twister, sports shoes, socks, sweatbands, and towels. The children will renovate the room and build the gym, providing them with activity and instilling a sense of pride. They will also be responsible for gym maintenance. The 120 boys at the prison are there because of poverty related crimes. They lived in small, overcrowded, and unhealthy conditions, often lacking basic sanitation. Some had to live in underground manholes just to survive.
