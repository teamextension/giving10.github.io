post-title: Nicaragua
post-summary: "$645 was given to pay for the rehabilitation of a water well in Nicaragua as well as a community workshop on health education there. 80% of rural Nicaraguans lack access to clean drinking water, free from contamination and disease. According to El Porvenir, the nongovernmental organization that is administering the project we funded, Many of these [water] sources also serve for bathing, washing clothes and watering animals. Diarrhea and dysentery, caused by water-borne organisms, are the principal cause of death for children under five. Many water sources are distant from the village, and the job of hauling water home in five-gallon buckets (which weigh 40 pounds) falls principally upon women and children."
