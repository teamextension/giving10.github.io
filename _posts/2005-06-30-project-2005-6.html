post-title: Karuna Trust
post-summary: $2,150 was given to the Karuna Trust to provide blankets and medicines to 200 street children living on the platforms at the Gaya Station in India. They survive by begging, scavenging, and trash-collecting, and are at great risk from violence and abuse, including child-prostitution and trade in organs for transplants. We will help provide the children with antibiotics, bandages, antiseptic soaps, scabies medicine, skin cream for sores, anti-lice shampoo, stomach medicines, and blood tests. According to Dryan Kitchener of the Karuna Trust, "There is little or no government help for these children because Bihar is India's poorest and most lawless state and civil administration has almost completely broken down. Furthermore most aid agencies have pulled out of Bihar because conditions are so dangerous." This again shows the importance of our work, as we reach out to the most desperate and often forgotten members of the global community.
