post-title: Educare Africa
post-summary: $2,260 was given to Educare Africa to fund the continuing education of 28 students in Cameroon. These eager kids range in age from 12 to 22 and without our support would likely miss the year completely and perhaps be permanently derailed in their education. Our funds will be used to buy textbooks, kerosene, school shoes, and food. For students who come from distant villages we will pay rent at a house in the town where the school is located. The students in our project this month come from various rural villages in Cameroon, where one-third of the nation (over 15 years old) is illiterate, and only 64% of the children reach grade 5. Each family lives in a compound, which often includes grandparents, uncles, cousins, and other relatives. Most of their houses are built from sun-dried bricks with a zinc roof. There is no electricity or running water.
