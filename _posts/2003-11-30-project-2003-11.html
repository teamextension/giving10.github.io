post-title: All As One children's Center
post-summary: "$1,110 was given to purchase a generator and two metal cribs at the All As One children's center in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The Center provides orphaned children with clothes, food, medical care and an education, while these precious children hopefully await adoption to loving families including families in the United States. According to the United Nations Human Development Report, life expectancy in this West African country is 34.5 years. The adult literacy rate there for people over age 15 is a meager 36%. The UN Report ranks 175 countries in its Human Development Index. Sierra Leone is dead last. The generator will power the equipment necessary to help provide some entertainment for these children who otherwise have languished through a miserable adolescence; it also will help them use educational materials so that they can, for instance, learn English. Deanna told me, It is not cost- effective to run our large generator during daylight hours for this small item [a TV]. This means the children do not get the maximum amount of learning opportunity - and also the fun and entertainment that would brighten their lives. As I'm typing this, the children are in the next room singing and dancing a cappella. How exciting it would be to hear them singing and dancing to some recorded music or listening to their laughter as they watch a child's film. She also noted that the generator will help them save a lot of money on fuel costs, which will free up funds for other aspects of their important work."
