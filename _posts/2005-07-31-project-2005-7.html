post-title: CEDESOL Foundation (Center for Development with Solar Energy)
post-summary: $2,200 was given to CEDESOL Foundation (Center for Development with Solar Energy) in La Paz, Bolivia to assist in their implementation of a solar cooker and efficient wood cooking program. Their experience suggests that this will relieve significant burdens among the most economically disadvantaged Bolivians. Part of the grant will be used in a revolving micro-credit fund helping folks purchase solar box cookers in such a way that the monthly fuel savings will about equal their payments. Initially, we will provide 20 box cookers at about $50 each, which can then be purchased for $10 down and about $6 a month. This will make additional cookers available for purchase each month in the same fashion as payments roll in. Another $828 of our grant will provide 6 solar cookers and 6 wood cookers (at $38 each) as donations to people of the indigenous Guarani Indian nation in southern Bolivia (which further includes $300 for transportation costs for the delivery team). They will be taught to use the wood cookers when they can not use the solar cookers, as a system, instead of the traditional 3 stone fire that uses considerable wood and causes dangerous respiratory problems due to smoke inhalation. Lastly, our grant will also be used to publish educational "how to" materials on the use of the different cooker types to increase public awareness and enhance the successful implementation and expansion of the project.
