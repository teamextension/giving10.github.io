post-title: Kakuma Camp
post-summary: "$470 was given to families at Kakuma Camp to fund the purchase of solar cookers for 47 vulnerable, elderly, and disabled refugee families at Kakuma Camp in Kenya through Solar Cookers International. Solar cookers help spare trees from being cut down for firewood, eliminate noxious gases from being emitted into the air as a result of burning wood, and remove the need for people to travel long distances to collect wood. According to the program manager at Solar Cookers International: Your offer comes at an opportune time as no firewood has been distributed at the camp for the last three months, which has been particularly hard on families already facing many challenges. We have found that providing an alternative to cooking on fire is particularly beneficial to the disabled and elderly. Vulnerable refugees who already solar cook report that solar cooking has improved their lives by reducing the risk of burns from fires, allowing them to keep food they otherwise would need to trade for firewood, and helping them feel less dependent on others."
