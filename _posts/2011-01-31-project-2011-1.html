post-title:  Kilimanjaro Orphanage Center
post-summary: $2,500 was given to the Kilimanjaro Orphanage Center to fund the acquisition and installation of a solar hot water heater. The Center provides food, clothing, shelter, education, spiritual guidance and medical care to the residents of the facility as well as to other needy children in the community. About 30 children currently live at the center, many of whom lost their parents to AIDS and all of whom are in need of care from others. The heater we will be helping the Center buy will allow for hot showers for the children, help prevent skin diseases and infections, and facilitate proper cleaning of the orphanage.

<p>Dear Friends:</p>
<p>Welcome to your January 2011 project report for Giving $10. I apologize for the delay in submitting this report - it has been a very hectic start to the year. February and March reports will follow soon.</p>
<p>The Kilimanjaro Orphanage Center (KOC) in Moshi, Tanzania was founded in early 2009 by Edward Lazaro responding to the recognized need to provide care and shelter to an increasing population of orphaned children in the Moshi area. The Center provides food, clothing, shelter, education, spiritual guidance and medical care to the residents of the facility as well as to other needy children in the community.</p>
<p>Currently KOC houses 30 children, mostly between the ages of 4 and 10, at a housing center in Pasua Tanzania a small community just outside of Moshi. The long term vision is to buy and build a preplanned community for up to 100 children.</p>
<p>There are so many heart-wrenching and heart-warming stories of the kids there.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Agnes, for instance, was under the long standing care of a maternal aunt who never liked her and who prevented her from attending school so that she could work full time in the house caring for the aunt's own children. Both of her parents died from AIDS.</li>
    <li>Esther's mother was murdered by her step father who is in prison. It remains unclear whether she has a biologic living father. She came to the orphanage in poor health suffering from malnutrition. She had received no schooling before arriving at the orphanage.</li>
    <li>Winifreda was living with an elderly grandmother who was unable to provide for her after the death of her parents from HIV. She has no siblings and she has never had visitors since going to the orphanage. She is a very shy and quiet child, but is very popular with all of the other children. She was one of my bravest children when taken to the dentist for tooth fillings.</li>
    <li>Gloria was being cared for on a farm on the slopes of Kilimanjaro by an elderly grandmother who was partially paralyzed by a stroke and by a grandfather who had lost a leg from an infection. Her mother died from HIV in 2005 and her father was never known. She has no brothers or sisters. After a long and tearful meeting with her caregivers who realized that they had little opportunity to offer her, she went to live at the Center.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Giving $10</h3>

<p>This month, 250 of us donated $2,500 to the Kilimanjaro Orphanage Center to assist in the acquisition and installation of a solar hot water heater. I'm told this will have an immediate, positive impact on the lives of the children there. It will, of course, provide the children with hot water for regular showers. Further, it will help reduce the risks of several medical problems for the children such as skin diseases and infections. Additionally, cleaning efforts will become far more effective having access to a ready source of hot water, facilitating the fight against the spread of germs and bacteria. Thank you.</p>
<p>Presumably, we all take access to hot water for granted. For Agnes, Esther, Wini, Gloria, and dozens of other children in Tanzania, it's a previously unknown treat that will improve their health and their lives overall. There is also an economic and environmental impact from our project, which will reduce the monthly overhead costs of heating or boiling water by propane or wood fire.</p>
<p>According to Jamie King, the project coordinator:</p>
<blockquote>The solar hot water heater will provide the children with hot water on a daily basis at no cost after the initial set up for at least the next 25 years, something the care givers and physicians are extremely excited about.</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for making this happen.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>I wanted to give you all an update on the Solar hot water project. After much delay and lots of hard work from Teacher and Greg they finally got the company we purchased the heater from to come back and finish the installation. On behalf of everyone at the orphanage I've been asked to tell you all how happy they are with the system and to thank you. The matrons are singing the praises of the system for how clean the children's clothes are coming as well as how clean the kids are getting. Thank you all so much for your help with this project, for many I know it is hard to visualize the difference you made in the lives of these children but having hot water will help with many of the daily chores that typically require propane or firewood as well as help control many of the skin disease problems that can occur. I have attached pictures of the system and some of it being built and used. We were also able to install several outdoor water hoses and plumb the kitchen, two showers, and a hot water sink outside for all the many chores they use water for. Thank you all for the help and support with this project, please give me a call or shoot me an email if you would like to hear more about the Orphanage and how things are going. - Jamie King</p>
