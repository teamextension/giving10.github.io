post-title: Poorna Health Care Trust
post-summary:$3,100 was given to the Poorna Health Care Trust to provide clean drinking water and special sanitary kits to mothers with infants in Sri Lanka as these poor souls recover from the dreaded tsunami disaster. Part of the money was used to supply water from a central water purification source to 3 camps for internally displaced people. These camps have a total of 4,007 people. As the camps are wide spread over vacant land and there are no water facilities on tap, it is very important that they have the equipment to ensure that water tanks around the camps are filled. Further, there are 280 mothers who were bottle feeding their babies. The $10 Club provided 53 kits to these women. Each kit included: 2 Bottle Brushes, 1 Feeding cup & plate, 1 Bowl & spoon, 1 Flask for hot water, 1 Container for milk powder, 2 Cakes Baby Soap, 2 Teats, and 1- 11 Ltr. Plastic Bucket with lid. The Poorna Health Care Trust was was established in 1996 to formalize social service activities for impoverished people in Sri Lanka, including support through a clinic at Ratnam's Hospital in Colombo.
