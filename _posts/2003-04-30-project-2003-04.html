post-title: Laguna School
post-summary: "$790 was given to provide hot school lunches to children at two schools in Belize for a month (480 hot, nutritious meals) and plant a community garden that will provide wholesome fruits and vegetables to the students there. Plenty Executive Director, Peter Schweitzer, said about this grant from The $10 Club: [your donation is] a big step in helping families in these villages become more aware of good nutrition habits and it puts value into the school lunch program which will only be sustainable if it's adopted by the schools and villagers. Descriptions of the two schools receiving our assistance follow: Laguna is a rural traditional Kek'chi Maya village of approximately 300. Laguna School has 91 students in the Belizean equivalent of grades K-8, and since 1999 has participated in the School Feeding Program. Seventy students receive a lunch three times a week, and they would like to provide a hot meal daily. Early last year, Plenty assisted the school by upgrading its water system, prior to which teachers and students had to haul water by bucket for from the nearest hand pump, about 100 yards from the kitchen. The remote, seaside Garifuna village of Barranco has 50 students in its primary school. The Garifuna people have been proclaimed a World Heritage Culture by the United Nations. Plenty has had a long connection with Barranco. Most recently we upgraded this school's water system, and worked with their volunteer cooks to demonstrate ways of preparing high protein soy foods in their lunch program. Due to its remote location and poverty, Barranco school has only been able to provide a hot meal to its 50 students, once a week, but would like to do more."
