post-title: WaterCan
post-summary: "$1,440 was given to WaterCan to fund the construction of a \"waterpoint\" (a communal tap-stand connected to a main municipal water system), and the necessary sanitation and hygiene education activities for local residents in Woreda, a slum area on the northern edge of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capitol. Beneficiaries will also be trained in basic repairs and maintenance to ensure the long-term viability of the waterpoint. The tap that we funded will directly serve approximately 80 water collectors. Since each water collector does so for a family of at least four others, well over 300 Ethiopians should benefit from our contribution. In a world in which more than one billion people lack access to safe drinking water, in Ethiopia, only 24% of the population is able to obtain this life-sustaining liquid."
