								<h3>How it all began - A Letter From the President</h3>
								<p>In the summer of 2002, I attended the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa where, for over a week, I was bombarded with information about the depressing state of global affairs and increasing poverty the world over. One can't help but be deeply affected at the knowledge that one billion people earn less than a dollar a day, and two billion people lack access to safe drinking water, sanitation, or electricity.</p>
								<p>As I listened to global leaders discuss the plight of the world's poor, it became obvious that national governments move slowly, if at all, and that nongovernmental organizations are limited in their financial resources and scope of work.</p>
								<p>So, as I grumbled in frustration in the back of the plenary room, I came up with this idea: Giving $10. My wife has an eight year old daughter and together we have four dogs and five cats; we both work for nonprofits; we give money to Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary, and make other charitable donations. As an individual I'm limited in the resources I can bring to the table for poverty eradication, but I concluded that if I could start by getting 100 people in my similar situation to give $10 a month, together we could make a direct difference of $1,000 to someone, to some group of people, somewhere in the world.</p>
								<p>On December 18, 2002, I sent a letter to friends, family and colleagues urging them to help me be a part of the solution.</p>
								<p>Giving $10 has been born, has established a record of success, and I ask for you to join us.</p>
								<p>Can you have one fewer martini each month to make a difference in someone's life? Can you pass on one new CD or DVD? Get a less expensive bottle of wine at a restaurant? Wait until that new outfit goes on sale? If so, you can help me try to increase educational opportunities, women's empowerment, water and sanitation availability, health access, delivery of alternative energy, organic agriculture tools and food distribution, and biodiversity conservation across the globe.</p>
								<p>What a wonderful holiday present to give yourself at the end of each year: a letter from me reviewing the thousands of dollars worth of projects we funded throughout the year.</p>
								<p>Please take a chance and help us make a difference. This is slowly blossoming into something special. Giving $10 has presented the world a model of independent, small-scale philanthropy that all should envy.</p>

									<h4>Dr. Peter McCormick <i>(Bansang Hospital Appeal)</i></h4>
									<p>Dear Adam; Anita and Steve Smith copied to me much of the correspondence that has recently passed between you. I must say I admire you and your friends for the fine work you are doing; deeply humanitarian in its conception, profoundly elegant in its simplicity, and hugely practical in its delivery. What you are doing echoes precisely what Paul Harris did in Chicago in 1905. Look what that led to; Rotary International with its ongoing mighty work for humanity. I wish you and your friends well, in the development of your work.</p>

									<h4>Elise Cooper <i>(El Porvenir)</i></h4>
									<p>It is very impressive and humbling to be the recipient of funds from your $10 Club. Your club is demonstrating how smaller amounts of money from many, when put together for one specific project, will spread out to affect the lives of a whole village.</p>
