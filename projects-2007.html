                                     <p>$3,500 was given to the Chikumbuso project in Zambia to expand their building and enhance their efforts to help Zambian women in need. The program is based in Ngombe Township, targeting widows, orphans and grandmothers whose lives have been changed by the devastating effect of HIV/AIDS. Our funds will be used to upgrade the building by providing cement, timber, sand, stones, cement blocks, roofing, doors, door frames, window frames and glass. Additionally, we'll be able to provide five new sewing machines, a variety of sewing materials, and kitchen utensils. This room will be used to hold literacy classes, HIV awareness talks, and skills training. The class will include training in sewing, preparation of formula for their infants who are not able to breastfeed, the preparation of healthy and affordable food, and life skills. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/01/09/project-2007-1.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,520 was given to Outreach for World Hope to fund the provision of anti-parasitic treatments throughout sixteen Guatemalan villages. Our grant will provide nearly 2,000 people with otherwise unaffordable parasite treatments through a Mobile Medicine Program. These treatments will impact the worms and parasites that compound malnutrition problems because children are unable to absorb nutrients efficiently-many children die of dehydration due to diarrhea caused by the parasites. The drugs that they use are called Albendazole and Mebendazol. One two-day course of treatment can keep a child free of worms and parasites for up to six months. This makes a significant improvement in their overall health and nutritional status. In rural areas, sick villagers have to travel considerable distances to visit clinics in the cities. And while they are diagnosed for free, they are often unable to pay for the treatments or medications. With our grant, poor, vulnerable children in Guatemala will be treated appropriately. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/02/10/project-2007-2.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,830 was given to Coptic Orphans to purchase books for approximately 500 underprivileged children in Egypt. Through the "Not Alone Program", the organization works to remedy the difficulties that lead to illiteracy-primarily the lack of access to school books. In addition to providing textbooks for use in school, there is a need to provide students with interesting, pleasurable books that the children can get at no cost and read for enjoyment. Given access to books that they want to read, these at-risk children will improve their reading skills and the confidence that comes with literacy. Coptic Orphans aims to diminish the disparity between rich and poor within the Egyptian educational system. As is so often the case, there is a real need to supplement provision of government services with assistance from the nonprofit sector. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/03/11/project-2007-3.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,700 was given to the International Conservation and Education Fund to produce a series of short (but life-saving) educational films in the Central African Republic on three health topics of relevance to the Ba'aka people and the survival of their culture. These films-about malaria, crippling parasitic fleas, and general hygiene-will be produced locally and shown throughout Ba'aka communities in the region. The Central African Republic is one of the least developed countries on the planet, ranked at 172 out of 177 on the United Nations Human Development Index. There is a mere 50/50 chance that people there will survive to age 40; more than 10% of infants die at birth; and a quarter of children under five years old are malnourished. Poor health is a significant contributor to national impoverishment and educational deficiencies. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/04/15/project-2007-4.html">Read more.</a></p>

When the city supplies water, the All As One workers are ready with hoses and small tanks to capture the water and keep it in reserve for a few days. They currently have five medium-sized tanks, but it only lasts three or four days if more water doesn't arrive to replenish them. When the city is not able to supply water, the staff seeks out water tankers and tries to convince the truck drivers to bring water to the children's center-which is challenging given the current demand and competition for limited water resources. According to a 2006 report by Oxfam in collaboration with WaterAid, in 2003, only 22 percent "of the population of some five million people had access to a sustainable supply of safe drinking water from a protected source. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/05/17/project-2007-5.html">Read more.</a></p>

In the heart of the poverty-stricken area of Villa Elisa lies a community center named Association Apoyo Familiar Casa del Nino Arco Iris (Arco Iris). Estimuladores (motivators) serve as positive role models for children at Arco Iris, engaging the kids who attend in social and educational activities, and providing them with some much-needed attention. When at home in the slums of Villa Elisa, many children must cook, clean and look after their siblings and/or cousins. For most of these kids, the only escape from this reality is their time spent at Arco Iris. Currently, Arco Iris does not have adequate facilities and supplies to meet the demand from local children, and the play area is little more than a filthy field. Our grant will support the salary of local men to do the construction, and pay for the wood, cement, sand, nails and screws, a slide, swing set, tire swing, monkey bars, basketball hoop, basketballs, soccer nets, soccer balls, jump ropes, hoola hoops, and bicycles. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/06/30/project-2007-6.html">Read more.</a></p>

The Wanchaq Center, where adolescents have access to professional training and educational assistance, has fallen into utter disrepair. More than 100 children currently use the facility, which has a leaky roof and lacks permanent walls. Our grant will be used to construct four wooden walls, install a secure roof and door, build a bathroom, set up electric service, coat the floor to provide stability, improve the library to offer better help with schoolwork and encourage good reading habits, and paint the facility. In a town where more than half the population lives in poverty it is vital that we step in and make what modest contribution we can to the children's long-term development and well-being. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/07/30/project-2007-7.html">Read more.</a></p>

In a nation where more than half of the population lives on less than a dollar a day, innovative economic opportunities-especially for women-are vitally important. Women in rural parts of Mali are hit particularly hard by poverty and they are often confined to traditional social roles; education is a serious part of the problem with 98% of the women in the community served by this project have never been to school. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/08/31/project-2007-8.html">Read more.</a></p>

Women cannot travel (some for several hours) to the Health Centre when they are in labor, even though they may want to deliver there. Our September grant enabled the building of the new facility where women could stay until birth free of charge provided they clean the rooms themselves. Our funds were used to build the substructure, including excavation over the site to level the ground and prepare trenches for the concrete foundation; fund the roofing, doors and windows, kitchen, a pit latrine, water piping from the water tank and a tap with a concrete base; lastly, pay for nine beds, lockers, blankets, and mattresses. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/09/30/project-2007-9.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,700 was given to War Child Canada to provide textbooks and pens for a literacy program at four camps for Internally Displaced People in and around Darfur, Sudan. Our donation enabled the distribution of 1,620 textbooks and 900 pens to kids in need. The textbooks cover basic literacy and math (depending on availability, hopefully in both Arabic and English). The aim of this informal education is to provide kids who have missed out on education to "catch-up" and rejoin regular school. The books will stay in the camps and, therefore, be able to help thousands of children there for years to come. Since 2005, War Child Canada has been successfully implementing its Humanitarian Relief Project in West Darfur, and has since established four support centers for displaced children and youth-one in each of the Ardamata, Dorti, Krinding and Riyad IDP camps located on the outskirts of El Geneina, West Darfur. Each camp has approximately 20,000 people. In addition to providing a safe space in the midst of incredible violence, the centers provide psychosocial support; literacy training; recreational activities including volleyball and soccer; and vocational training in masonry and food preservation. Such programming helps to improve the overall well-being of children and others, alleviate poverty, and deter young males from joining rebel armies and militias. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/11/30/project-2007-11.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,830 was given to Hôpital Albert Schweitzer (HAS) to repair the roads to its health centers in Haiti. With our grant, HAS can hire teams to repair and maintain the most damaged sections of road. The teams will break up boulders and add river rock to fill the gullies, making for a more passable road. They will improve the worst 1.5 kilometers of the Tienne-Gabriel road. We provide funds for the hiring of masons and give them the tools they need to accomplish the task at hand. This month we will allow for safer transport of patients and equipment, thus maintaining the hospital's important connection with its rural neighbors. HAS staff uses all-terrain vehicles when traveling to the health centers. The roads-washed out gullies-leading to the health centers can be extremely treacherous. Vehicles have difficulty traveling in the muddy ruts which contain boulders. Due to the isolated location, if a vehicle becomes damaged on the rough roads it can be out of commission for an extended period waiting for repair parts to be delivered. This delay directly affects patient care because of the interrupted delivery of medicines, vaccines, and other medical supplies. <a href="/projects-2007/2007/12/31/project-2007-12.html">Read more.</a></p>
