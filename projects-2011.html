The Center provides food, clothing, shelter, education, spiritual guidance and medical care to the residents of the facility as well as to other needy children in the community. About 30 children currently live at the center, many of whom lost their parents to AIDS and all of whom are in need of care from others. The heater we will be helping the Center buy will allow for hot showers for the children, help prevent skin diseases and infections, and facilitate proper cleaning of the orphanage. <a href="/projects-2011/2011/01/31/project-2011-1.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$2,700 was given to Fundacion Entropika to provide potable water to an indigenous community in the Peruvian Amazon, specifically for 330 people in the Vista Alegre community. With last year's incredibly dry season, communities close to the Amazon River lacked access to safe water and faced an alarming sanitary crisis, which exposed local people especially children and the elderly to water-borne diseases. We will fund installation of a tubwell system for pumping water from the Amazon; promote safe use of potable water; increase awareness of the dangers of contaminated water; raise awareness of hygiene and sanitation issues; and ensure safe water to the community. <a href="/projects-2011/2011/02/28/project-2011-2.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$2,600 was given to the Apostolic Carmel School in Sri Lanka to fund the annual salary of two teachers there. Children in Sri Lanka continue to suffer from a variety of significant daily stressors: family violence and internal strife, ongoing post-tsunami rebuilding, flooding, food insecurity, and the impacts of civil war. This small girls school serves just under 100 students. It came into existence in 1985 as a result of children not being well cared-for at home and lacking sufficient educational opportunities. About half of the girls are housed in modest dormitory facilities these are students from untenable home situations. <a href="/projects-2011/2011/03/31/project-2011-3.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$2,580 was given to Fundación Eudes to carry out their mobile health service program in Bogota, Colombia for the next three months for advocacy and prevention of HIV/AIDS. Our grant enables women's health exams (including HIV testing), dental services; legal and other support, and workshops in healthy lifestyles. Poverty, combined with lack of education, fragile living situations, and limited access to health services increases the risk of infection and exacerbates the social and psychological stigmas surrounding HIV/AIDS. Prevention and awareness-raising is left to private health companies, local departments and non-governmental organizations. <a href="/projects-2011/2011/04/30/project-2011-4.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$2,560 Was given to the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme (EWCP) to support educational development and environmental stewardship in the rural areas of the northern highlands of Ethiopia. The schools that EWCP is targeting are situated far from towns and villages, high in the Simien Mountains, where resources are scarce and the children who attend school, walking through rain and wind across the desolate highlands, are seen as the lucky ones. We will enable the printing of 1,500 exercise books for children in ten target schools, design and print 50 teacher's manuals, and enable the school nature clubs to manufacture efficient, low cost cooking stoves <a href="/projects-2011/2011/05/30/project-2011-5.html">Read more.</a></p>

Remaining funds were used for antibiotics, antifungal creams, vitamins, and antiparasitics. Transportation of materials was donated and labor undertaken by volunteers. Madiana is a village of approximately 5,000 people about 10 miles from the nearest clinic in a neighboring village, and 50 miles from a larger hospital in the capital Banjul. Donkey carts, bicycles, and for-hire bush taxis provide the only transportation. The dirt roads are nearly impassable during the rainy season, April to November, increasing the remoteness and access to health care. Our grant provided access to health services closer to home. <a href="/projects-2011/2011/09/30/project-2011-9.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$2,500 was given to Wells Bring Hope to help fund the drilling of a well in Niger. In Niger, 52% of the entire population and 70% of rural villages lack access to clean water. Women and girls typically walk 4-6 miles per day to find water for their families. Mothers must enlist the help of their daughters for this difficult task. As a result, young girls don't get an education. While the Niger government recognizes the serious need to provide safe water for its people, they can afford to drill only 10% of the 12,000 wells needed. Lack of access to potable water is the single most important factor for the high mortality rate among children there. One out of four children dies before the age of five, typically from diarrhea or other water-borne diseases. <a href="/projects-2011/2011/11/30/project-2011-11.html">Read more.</a></p>

Butuntumula is a sub-county of the Luwero District in Uganda with approximately 35,000 people. People in the community travel miles to get access to moderately safe drinking water. The elderly, including those suffering from blindness and other debilitations, have to care for children who have lost their parents. Most orphaned children are unable to attend school and some have to work in local markets selling fish while simultaneously looking after their younger siblings. <a href="/projects-2011/2011/12/31/project-2011-12.html">Read more.</a></p>
