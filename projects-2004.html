                                     <p>$1,270 was given to Volunteer Peten, an organization working in Guatemala. The money will buy textbooks, dictionaries, thesauri, and atlases for three classes in each of three different schools in La Union, Ixhuacut and El Tigre. Additionally, a photocopier, paper, toner, and book binding supplies will be attained to enable educators there to copy and share other papers for curent and future students in these and neighboring communities. While literacy levels are very low in Guatemala--far below the average for Latin America--and children have a difficult time staying in school, 180 children will be helped immediately as a result of this project and have a better chance at a quality education and life out of poverty. </p>

                                     <p>$1,300 was given to the Born Free Foundation Global Friends Program to fund the construction and delivery of 8 desks and 80 chairs to students at the Ngaga School in Uganda. Before Born Free's support of the school, each class had a blackboard suspended from their class tree. When it rained, kids would be forced to scurry for shelter in a nearby church. Now, a building has been constructed and the number of children attending the school has doubled. Before The $10 Club's support of the school, each class used make-shift panels of wood atop bricks for benches and had no desks. Now, desks and chairs will be available, enabling the children the opportunity to work in groups and provide a more positive learning environment. Uganda ranks in the bottom one-fifth of the nations of the world on the United Nations Human Development Index. One-third of Ugandan adults over age 15 are illiterate.</p>

                                     <p>$1,440 was given to WaterCan to fund the construction of a "waterpoint" (a communal tap-stand connected to a main municipal water system), and the necessary sanitation and hygiene education activities for local residents in Woreda, a slum area on the northern edge of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capitol. Beneficiaries will also be trained in basic repairs and maintenance to ensure the long-term viability of the waterpoint. The tap that we funded will directly serve approximately 80 water collectors. Since each water collector does so for a family of at least four others, well over 300 Ethiopians should benefit from our contribution. In a world in which more than one billion people lack access to safe drinking water, in Ethiopia, only 24% of the population is able to obtain this life-sustaining liquid.</p>

                                     <p>$1,570 was given to Onneyshan to fund the construction of 24 water-seal latrines in Lalmath Basti, a slum in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, where 25 million people live in abject poverty earning less than a dollar a day, only an estimated 14% of slum households in the metropolitan cities have sanitary latrines. Unbelievably, 125,000 Bangladeshi children die every year because of diarrheal diseases. Open defacation pollutes the water that poor families there use for cooking, cleaning, and bathing. 50%-60% of the funds we donated for this project are recoverable: beneficiaries of the project make payments in very small portions over time and the money that is returned will ultimately be reinvested into an expansion of the sanitation project.</p>

                                     <p>$1,610 was given to the New Hope Rural Leprosy Project in India to construct 10 brick row house units to provide waterproof and safe housing for people afflicted with leprosy. India is one of ten countries that has not been able to meet global leprosy elimination goals. In fact, India represents approximately three-quarters of the global leprosy burden with 473,658 new cases detected in 2002. The New Hope Rural Leprosy Trust undertakes more than a dozen programs including leprosy eradication, care of victims, health education, and immunization. The Director notes that the people he encounters with leprosy experience a loss of sensation in their fingers, hands, toes, and feet. Women burn their fingers while cooking, not feeling the heat. Men develop blisters while doing labor work and don't feel the pain.</p>

                                     <p>$1,720 was given to the Human Development Foundation in Bangkok, Thailand, which runs the Mercy Centre. The money will be used to buy uniforms, shoes, sports clothing and sneakers, backpacks and school supplies, and fund field trips for 17 teenagers enrolling in a new literacy program operated by the Centre. These kids were orphaned, sold into the Thai sex trade, or subjected to other forms of abuse in their adolescent years. As a result of the new program, and the uniforms and supplies, they will have a sense of pride and self-respect, and a chance at a bright new future, armed with a valuable education. The Mercy Centre is embedded in Klong Toey, the worst slum area of Bangkok.</p>

Currently, pumping oxygen into patients manually is not adequately regulated and does not enable the patient to be stabilized sufficiently. Scheer receives trauma and acute medical cases by the busloads; installation of an air compression system to their ventilators will enable patients to be stabilized and have their lives saved. Some patients walk for days to get to the hospital; others are carried by friends or family members on homemade stretchers or even by 'piggyback'. Despite overwhelming poverty in the region, no one is ever turned away from Scheer for lack of money over 35% of the cases there are charity cases, and most of the hospital's equipment and labor are donated.</p>

One project, operated by a local group called the Pole-Pole Foundation, is a sewing cooperative to enable local women to make dresses, shirts, and other garments for sale, thus generating their own source of sustainable income. The other, the Association de Femmes pour la Conservation et la Developpment Durable, promotes sustainable agriculture. Rebel soldiers recently ransacked the sewing project, destroying machines and stealing material, while more than 100 women were brutally attacked and raped. The $10 Club grant will provide eight new sewing machines, fabric, scissors, needles, pins, chalk and other items to help reconstruct the sewing project, and provide transport and other expenses for three women to receive victim support training and learn rape counseling techniques from Doctors on Call for Service, which they can then administer to other women.</p>

                                     <p>$1,830 was given to the Needy Hospice outside Arusha, Tanzania to feed roughly 70 people for a period of nine weeks. This is a pivotal time for full food service as patients will be receiving seminars about HIV/AIDS, transmission, prevention, societal stigma, and nutrition. This grant will buy cooking oil, rice, wheat flour, oranges, potatoes, carrots, garlic, green beans, soybeans, peanuts, and maize flour, all from a local farm and local markets. Needy Hospice is a voluntary non-profit organization founded in 1988 to serve the terminally ill, particularly individuals who are HIV positive, including patients whose illness has progressed to the advanced stages of AIDS. A remarkable number of people in this region suffer and die from starvation and nutritional deficiencies. Patrick, a volunteer with the Hospice, tells me that although terminally ill patients are too often neglected and overlooked when it comes to healthcare services, especially those stricken with HIV/AIDS he believes that by serving this community we can help to lift the rampant stigma of HIV/AIDS in Tanzania, better the quality of life, and ease some of the suffering these patients experience.</p>

The Chikomba Community District Committee will help identify children with specific needs and, in consultation with CAMFED's representatives in Zimbabwe, ensure that these tailored educational needs are met. The $10 Club Safety-Net Fund could mean providing one girl with pens or exercise books costing around a dollar, allowing her to return to school the following day, or providing a full bursary of around eighteen dollars to pay examination fees, buy uniforms, shoes, stationary, or sanitary items. In some cases, this will mean a student is able to attend school for the first time.</p>

Laos is one of the nations most heavily littered with unexploded ordnances. Health care facilities in Laos are limited, making rehabilitation for landmine survivors, many of whom live in remote areas, difficult. According to the United Nations Mine Action Service, since 1975 there have been some 11,000 mine-related casualties in Laos. Currently, a minimum of 150 accident casualties are reported each year, but the actual number is surely much higher. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines' 2004 Landmine Monitor Report adds that some 37 percent of Laos's land area is at risk from unexploded ordnance, with more than 12,000 square kilometers considered "high risk."</p>
