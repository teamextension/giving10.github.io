            <p>These girls have made quite the transition since arriving a little of a year ago, and all have benefitted greatly from having proper dental care, as despite their young ages, they already had mouths full of cavities. Lizbeth, the eldest, will require orthodontic care when she is older, but we are glad that her teeth will be healthy and strong before she gets braces. All of our girls get regular dental check-ups and treatment as necessary. By partnering with Smiles Forever, a philanthropic dental organization, we're able to make your dollars stretch even further by receiving discounted dental care for all of our children.</p>

            <p>This is Matias the day he arrived, while he's almost six months old in this photo, he appeared to be much younger. With funding from the $10 Club, we were able to ensure that we could continue providing the nutritonal supplements and medical care he needed in order to make the major gains that he did this year.</p>

            <p>Proper food preparation and kitchen hygiene is essential in Bolivia as our children are so easily susceptible to parasites, amoebas, and bacterial infections if the food is not prepared or cooked correctly, or if the water is not completely pasteurized.</p>

            <p>Our staff work alongside nursing students who do part of their practicum in pediatrics with us, making sure that our children are well cared for. Above you see Matias getting cream on his face, which is especially important at this altitude, as the sun and wind can easily chap skin, especialy with young children.

            <p>Above, the children are listening to one of our staff share about how to wash hands properly. It's been great to see our young ones work hand washing into their everyday routine, it's really cut down on the number of colds in our homes and daycare. You made it possible to ensure that we had soap and alcohol gel to keep those germs at bay.

            <p>Daniel, a normally very easily distracted four year old absolutely loves to help the staff clean. As soon as he puts his special "cleaning helmet" on, he's focused and ready to go! With his health issues, it's important that he learns from an early age how to take good care of himself and his surroundings.

            <p>Jose, now over one year old, is enjoying playing with the other children. He still often wears a bib because he hasn't quite gotten control of swallowing his saliva, but it's getting consistently better. He'll need special orthodontic work when he's older, but he is now totally healed and doing very well.

            <p>Here is a photo taken in October of Margarita with her new glasses and prosthetic eye. Funds from The $10 Club paid for the prosthetic eye. Being able to purchase the correct sized prosthesis as she grows prevents infections and helps Margarita feel more comfortable with her appearance.
