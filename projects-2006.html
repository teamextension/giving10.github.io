                                     <p>$2,630 was given to Daniel Levitis, a PhD candidate in the Zoology Department of the University of California, to deliver 400 family-sized bednets to protect the entire village of Herowana in Papua New Guinea against mosquito borne diseases. A portion of the funds will also be used to provide the villagers with necessary medicines including antibiotics and malaria tablets. The thousand people of Herowana are organized into roughly 400 families. The public health apparatus in PNG was supposed to deliver mosquito nets to Herowana last year but they are under-funded and disorganized and now have no specific plan to get to Herowana. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has made family-sized mosquito nets available in the provincial capital, Goroka, for 15 Kina, equivalent to $5. The people of Herowana cannot afford $5 to buy their own nets and most have never been to Goroka. Historically, Herowana was at the upper altitudinal limit of mosquito borne diseases such as malaria. However, as surrounding ecosystems have been altered by development, habitat destruction, and climate change, mosquitoes have been moving up hill and bringing diseases with them. <a href="/projects-2006/2006/01/09/project-2006-1.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$2,780 was given to the Zatik Orphanage in Yerevan, Armenia to pay for 9 teachers to tutor students there for four months. Subjects covered include Russian, English, math biology, physics, Armenian, and art. There are many children in the Zatik Orphanage who are significantly behind in their education, having been brought in from life on the streets. Also, there are some children who want to have higher education after secondary school, but need to have extra private educational training to be able to reach their goals. Deteriorating economic and social conditions since the early 1990s have had a disastrous effect on Armenia's prized educational system. More than one-third of preschool institutions were lost between 1991 and 2000. One-quarter of state and community extra-school institutions have disappeared and enrollment there has dropped by nearly two-thirds. There also has been a 40% decline in the number of professional technical colleges. Publicly-funded education, though guaranteed in the Constitution, has been termed "an illusion." <a href="/projects-2006/2006/02/08/project-2006-2.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$2,910 was given to Shan Orphan Support on the Thai / Burma border to support their school-based health centers by providing teacher/nurse training, medical and dental supplies, and personal hygiene items including soap and shampoo. We also provided all the orphans with sandals for their feet. The teacher/nurse will assume duties regarding simple health and dental care for the kids in coordination with the village nurse. Approximately 1,000 children (including 300 orphans) currently reside in three different camps for internally displaced people along the border between Thailand and the Shan State in Burma. Some of the children in these camps are former child soldiers who fought to avenge their parents and have since been disarmed and enrolled in school. Others are victims of violence who saw their parents murdered and villages burned, and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorders. Still others are victims of sexual violence. The children are suffering from many common childhood illnesses and hygiene issues that are exacerbated by lack of resources - sore throats, earaches, fevers, coughs, septic wounds and scrapes, rashes, cuts, and sprains. We'll help provide the children with dozens of vital medicines and supplies including penicillin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, antifungal and antibacterial creams, vitamins, calamine lotion, rubbing alcohol, bandages, etc. Many diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS) require long-term treatments and are sensitive to reliable application of medicine - lack of oversight is a serious problem. We'll help ensure that there is proper supervision of medical treatments so they can be applied consistently. <a href="/projects-2006/2006/03/13/project-2006-3.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,060 was given to Hope Jackson to support a clinic in Los Talpetates, El Salvador, a rural village of 1,500 people more than two hours from the nearest city. It is the only independently run women's health clinic in the country and has been run under the capable leadership of Josefa Mira since it began operation in 1998. The clinic receives no government funding. Without outside support, hundreds of the neediest in El Salvador will be deprived of the health care they desperately require. With our support they will be able to purchase much-needed medical supplies including: prenatal vitamins, gauze pads and sponges, disposable syringes, sutures, umbilical cord clamps, digital blood pressure monitors, fetal heartbeat monitors, medicines for bronchial infection, pregnancy tests, and thermometers. Additionally, our money will be used to re-cover the palm roof that covers the porch and provides shade; buy new fans and window screens for the birthing room; paint the inside walls of the clinic; buy file cabinets for medical records, a typewriter, and midwifery resource books; and a sewing machine to enable mothers to sew clothes and diapers for their children. <a href="/projects-2006/2006/04/09/project-2006-4.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,260 was given to Eleanore's Project to provide 11 disabled Jordanian children with specially-fitted wheelchairs. It is estimated that 20 million people worldwide need wheelchairs and do not have them; of those, 6-7 million are children with disabilities in poor countries. Traditionally, children with disabilities in some countries have been considered a source of tremendous shame for their parents. In rural areas, a child with a disability, particularly a physical disability, still shames the honor of the family. For children in particular, a properly sized wheelchair with postural supports that can be adjusted as the child grows is more than just mobility. It is a therapeutic tool that can help a child develop motor control, increased tolerance for sitting, and improved functional use of the hands. It can assist a child's eating, digestion and breathing. Proper seating and positioning can limit or prevent orthopedic deformities and pressure sores that result in loss of function, hospitalizations, surgeries and even death. The problem, however, is that in developing countries there is rarely access to chairs in children's sizes with specialized seating systems. For a child with muscular imbalances, sitting in a folding wheelchair that is too big and lacks proper hip, trunk, back and head support can actually increase his or her physical problems <a href="/projects-2006/2006/05/07/project-2006-5.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,260 was given to Imani House for their clinic and educational operations in Liberia to provide: medicines for the clinic; materials for the sewing class and a sewing machine; a one year's stipend for the clinic nurse; stationary and clinic charts; and gas, tires and transportation costs for their vehicle. The more than three million inhabitants of the West African nation of Liberia, still emerging from 14 years of civil war, face numerous serious challenges. Life expectancy is just about 40 years old; half the adult population is illiterate; and 39% of the population is undernourished. Our grant will enable Ms. Iderabdullah to acquire chloroquine injections to fight malaria, baby liquids and tablets, paracetamol, antihistamines, needles, syringes, antispasmodics, hypertension medication, thermometers, gauze, bandages, antiseptics, pain killers, dental supplies, birthing kits, and water proof bedding supplies. Additionally, twenty women are already registered in the sewing class. During the civil war, the offices were looted and all the sewing machines were lost. Three of them have been replaced and one more is needed. The women use their newly-learned sewing skills to design and produce clothing to wear and to sell. For some, it will be the only source of income for their families. <a href="/projects-2006/2006/06/13/project-2006-6.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,230 was given to El Porvenir to construct 19 latrines in the La Pita community of Nicaragua. The community of La Pita is a rural village located 26 kilometers southeast of the municipality of Ciudad Dario, specifically in the district of Hispangual, in Nicaragua. There are 20 families there with 89 people in them, and 19 houses in the village (two families share one house). Most of the homes are of adobe, clay, or scrap lumber, and a few are made of local brick. Our grant will fund the bricks, cement, sand, precast floors and seats, zinc for the roof, nails, pipes, hinges, wood, hasp locks, tools, and staff time including hygiene workshops. The members of the community are all ready to provide the voluntary labor for the project, such as in digging the latrine holes and constructing their own family latrine. Without latrines there is a serious risk of proliferation of vector insects such as flies and consequently there are epidemics of diarrhea or even more serious diseases such as cholera and parasitosis. The most affected are small children-two million children die globally each year from diarrhea and the resultant dehydration and malnutrition. <a href="/projects-2006/2006/07/15/project-2006-7.html">Read more.</a></p>

These supplies will go a long way toward fulfilling their educational needs. As students will start their studies again in the first week of September, this grant is particularly timely. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, but also ranks among the world's poorest, ranking at 158 (out of 177) on the United Nations Human Development Index. Life expectancy in the country is 43 years old and average per capita income is less than $3 a day. The vast majority of Nigerians, however, earn far less than that.  <a href="/projects-2006/2006/08/12/project-2006-8.html">Read more.</a></p>

These workers are mostly employed as rubber-tappers in the local rubber plantation. There are many illiterate people in the village and those that surround it. Many children are not able to receive an education because of the large distance between their villages and the closest schools. If children receive an education at all, it is often ended after just a few years. <a href="/projects-2006/2006/10/10/project-2006-10.html">Read more.</a></p>

As a result of our grant, 100 peasant farmers who have their own community palm oil farm will be able to reap substantive profits from their plantations. This grant will be used to purchase a 400 liter tank to boil the palm seeds; two motors to crush them; two pestles; a generator and a press; seven barrels; plastic sheeting on which to dry the seeds before grinding; five buckets; two wheelbarrows; tables and molds for making soaps; and a scale. Further, we will support a supervisor and two workers to oversee the project and train the farmers. This will improve opportunities for economic growth for their families and the community in general. It will mean more money for food and schooling and other essentials they currently lack. It will mean hope for the future. <a href="/projects-2006/2006/11/14/project-2006-11.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,340 was given to the Sarawak Biodiversity Centre to build an Interpretive Centre and Community Garden, which will be a place for the community to discuss traditional knowledge, sell crafts to tourists, document useful information about indigenous plants, and teach future generations about survival in the forest. Our funds will provide plywood for the ceiling, window frames, glass windows, door frames and doors, interior wooden walls, wooden planks for steps, paint for ceiling and walls, wire mesh for the ceiling, nails, fuel for the generator to cut the planks, shelves for material display, and cabinets for storage. <a href="/projects-2006/2006/12/12/project-2006-12.html">Read more.</a></p>
