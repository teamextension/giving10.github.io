                                     <p>$4,100 was given to AMEPANE in Mali from The $10 Club and UK-based High Five Club to buy 1,500 notebooks, 500 small blackboards with 5,000 pieces of chalk, more than 3,000 pens and pencils and more than a thousand erasers, and nearly 700 treated mosquito nets. The people of Mali's Bafing Fauna Reserve, where January's project took place, suffer from a serious lack of supplies, despite the fact that people understand the need for schooling. There is an insufficient number of classrooms; large number of students; few teachers; severe lack of school supplies; poor water wells and latrines in the schools; and difficulty in keeping girls in school because they have to work in the fields to help their families. Additionally, the people there lack health infrastructures and health care staff. Mali is one of the poorest countries on the planet, ranking 173rd out of 177 countries listed on the United Nations Human Development Report. <a href="/projects-2009/2009/01/31/project-2009-1.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,660 was given to MOCAMDERCO to support their work throughout 15 communities in Panama. Specifically, we will underwrite local drawing and singing contests in school; meetings with communities to discuss reforestation projects; creation of nurseries; meetings with local groups to discuss agricultural development; establishment of agricultural projects; a summer youth camp; and project evaluation meetings with the communities. The population living in the territory in which this project will be implemented is composed of many young people, the majority of whom come from rural farming families. In terms of economic conditions, the predominant economic status of these communities is extreme poverty, demonstrated by the absence of essential infrastructure such as electricity, running water, and adequate outhouses. The World Bank estimates poverty among indigenous Panamanians running at 95%. <a href="/projects-2009/2009/02/28/project-2009-2.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,600 was given to Health in Harmony in Indonesia to fund the addition of a portable microscope and laboratory supplies for their mobile health clinic to improve diagnosis and treatment of the patients served in remote areas. The laboratory supplies will also allow clinic staff to test for parasites, do blood counts, and test for syphilis. All of these tests are essential to improve diagnosis and treatment. The quantity of supplies ordered is estimated to last one year or more. The beneficiaries live around the Gunung Palung National Park area of Indonesia. The communities around the Park are severely impoverished with little or no access to good healthcare. Local health care options are limited and expensive, making the mobile clinic vital. One-third of the households surveyed reported that they previously had to choose between food and medicine. Poverty and poor health are locked together around Gunung Palung in a mutually-reinforcing pattern. <a href="/projects-2009/2009/03/31/project-2009-3.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,700 was given to Rose Charities to support their work performing eye surgeries in Cambodia. Our donation will restore the sight of approximately 630 people through the acquisition of Intra-ocular implantable lenses and other supplies needed for the surgery. Cambodia is estimated to have 100,000 people who are totally or partially blind. Over seventy percent have surgically treatable conditions, such as cataracts and early glaucoma. The majority of Cambodians cannot afford health care. Many eye infections and diseases are left untreated for years. Cataracts and other conditions are allowed to progress until they cause total blindness. Sight restoration enables Cambodians to work, to get educated, to look after children. A simple operation implanting an artificial lens, can literally give these folks in need a new lease on life. It will change their lives. <a href="/projects-2009/2009/04/30/project-2009-4.html">Read more.</a></p>

                                     <p>$3,400 was given to Hope Jackson who attended a midwifery exchange program in Kafountine, Senegal with The African Birth Collective. We funded necessary supplies for their training and medical implementation programs including fund fifteen cases of sutures, four cases of surgical gloves, five Kelly forceps, five cases of syringes, five infant resuscitators, and two cases of mucus traps. In addition, manuals on training in suturing and resuscitation were printed into the local language, Wolof. Further, the supplier of these products sold them at the wholesale cost, saving enough money for us to also fund the purchase of a supply of pitocin (to treat postpartum hemorrhage) and lidocaine (to use as pain medication during suturing). The infant mortality rate in Senegal is 60 per 1,000 live births, ten times the rate in the United States. One clinic in our project area alone records an average of 600 births per year. As the midwifery skills are shared with other clinics in the region, the ripple effect will be great. <a href="/projects-2009/2009/12/31/project-2009-12.html">Read more.</a></p>
